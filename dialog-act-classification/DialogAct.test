Advisor: [social-other] Let me check your profile
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I saw you took ENGR101
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you find programming interesting?
Student: Not at all, to be honest,
Student: I find debugging irritating.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] In this case, I suggest you consider EECS 203
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's not a programming class
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's called Discrete Math
Student: Sounds like an interesting course.
Student: But is it an easy course?
Student: I'd like to lower my workload for the next semester.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is pretty easy
Student: Great, I'll take EECS 203 then.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Nice. What other areas are you interested in?
Student: I'm interested in physics.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I saw that you took physics140
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] In this case I suggest taking physics 240
Student: Sounds good.
Student: But I got A+ in 140.
Student: I might take 260 instead.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Based on your performance, I think you would go great in 260
Student: Great! Thank you for your help!
Advisor: [social-open-close] No problem, hope you the best!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi there
Student: Hi mate.
Advisor: [pull-other] How can I help today
Student: I've decided to major in cs.
Student: What courses do you think I should take next?
Student: Are you still there?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Great. For CS majors, you are required to take 370 281 and 370
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] These might be good courses you plan to take
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you want to take a programming course next semester?
Student: Yeah, I can take one or two programming classes.
Student: What's the workload of EECS 281?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] 281 is a pretty heavy class
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's the gateway course for CS students
Advisor: [pull-other] How did you do in 280?
Student: That is awesome. I like to challenge myself with hard courses.
Student: I got A+ in 280 effortlessly.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Impressive, I think 281 will be a class you will enjoy then
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you enjoy math more or would you like to learn about how computer works?
Student: I'm good with entry level math, but not the harder ones like Math 255.
Student: I almost failed Math 255.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] Based on this case, and if you are determined to take 281, you might also want to do 370
Student: That is manageable.
Student: Ok I know what to do now.
Student: Many thanks mate!
Advisor: [social-open-close] No problem! All the best!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello! I'm your advisor today. How can I help?
Student: Hello, I'm struggling to make a plan and need a suggestion
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in taking computer science courses?
Student: Yes, I'm definitely interested in CS classes
Student: I have taken ENGR101 already
Advisor: [social-other] Great! Let me think for a while.
Advisor: [pull-select] Which one do you like more, math-oriented courses or programming courses?
Student: Hmmmm, I like both of these types
Advisor: [pull-fill] What class size do you prefer?
Student: I like large course classes, so I can meet a lot of people
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your preference on class size, I would recommend EECS 183.
Student: What kind of workload does it have? I want a relaxing semester
Advisor: [push-other] It's pretty intense.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] But since you've taken ENGR 101, I'm sure you will find EECS 183 a lot easier.
Student: That's perfect! I will mark it down! Any suggestions for math-oriented class?
Advisor: [pull-fill] What math courses have you taken already?
Student: I have taken Math 115 and 116
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Ok, so I suggest you to take EECS 203 next.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Actually you can take EECS 203 along with EECS 183.
Student: Wow, that's sounds a perfect schedule to me
Student: Thank you so much
Advisor: [social-open-close] Great! I wish you all the best.
Student: Bye bye

Student: Hi, I'm Stephen. I'm graduating and hope to figure out a great final year
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hullo mate!
Advisor: [pull-select] Which one do you prefer, software development, robotics, video games, or something related to hardware?
Student: Yoooo, I'm super interested in software development! What are some cool classes I can take!
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] For seniors with a goal of doing software development in mind, I strongly suggest them to take EECS 381.
Student: What is that class?
Advisor: [push-other] It basically advanced c/c++ programming.
Student: Yooo, sounds great
Student: what is its workload like?
Advisor: [push-other] It's the heaviest here at Michigan.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] So based on the courses you have taken, I think you will find EECS 381 very challenging.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] A milder SDE course would be EECS 481.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Actually you are required to take EECS 376 to graduate as a CS student.
Student: Oh, yeah, I nearly forgot that
Student: I also need a capstone course
Student: Any suggestions?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I think you will find EECS 494 interesting and rewarding.
Advisor: [push-other] It's a game developing course, but You are expected to do tons of programming.
Student: But I don't like 494, I want to SDE, is it a capstone?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes it is a capstone.
Advisor: [push-other] Trust me you will like it.
Student: Sounds great
Student: Thank you so much
Student: you are the best
Advisor: [social-continue] I'm glad to help.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a good day!

Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I suggest you take EECS492: Artificial Intelligence.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Is that ok?
Student: Sounds interesting
Student: I will take your advice, thank you
Advisor: [social-open-close] Bye
Student: I have to rush to my class. It was nice talking to you
Student: Bye

Student: Hi
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi
Student: I waited for you for sometime already
Advisor: [social-continue] Explain that
Student: Never mind
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] My time is precious
Student: I have taken classes of Asian, Spanish, Physics, Math and EECS. But I still haven't decided what major to go
Student: Do you have any suggestions?
Advisor: [pull-select] From those courses you've taken, which one you liked most?
Student: Spanish
Advisor: [pull-fill] Why?
Student: Sorry I was wrong, I like EECS best
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Ok, actually many students told me they are interested in EECS.
Student: Okay then I will declare EECS as my major
Student: Thank you
Student: Bye

Student: Hi Advisor Choulou Shen
Student: Nice to meet you
Advisor: [pull-bool] Yes.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Nice to meet you too
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you here for advice on course selection?
Student: Yep for course planning for next semester
Student: I want to take some upper level courses next semester
Student: And I think that I have met all the prerequisites.
Student: Do you have any suggestions?
Advisor: [pull-fill] Can you think of any fields that you're interested in?
Student: HCI
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] To be honest, there is not much HCI course in the EECS department.
Student: Oh that's so sad
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] But there is some related ones
Student: Glad to hear that
Student: What are they?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] There is a course called Mobile Development.
Student: How's that related to HCI?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] In this course, you can learn something that is related to interaction design,
Student: I see
Student: How many credits is that
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's a 4-credit course
Student: I'll take it under consideration
Student: Any other suggestions?
Student: I'm also interested in Machine Learning
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] For Machine Learning, I think the EECS445 Introduction to Machine Learning is a good one.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You can learn many concepts in Machine Learning in this course.
Student: I heard it has very heavy workload
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, it is.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] If you put time in it, I think you can learn a lot.
Student: Okay I will work hard next semester
Student: Thank you for your advise
Student: Byebye
Advisor: [social-open-close] Bye

Student: Hi Advisor
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you Meili Yang?
Student: I heard that EECS will charge 2000 dollars more than other majors, is that true?
Student: No my name is Shazi Shen
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, that's true. Because if you're a CS major, you can access to many resources that others majors cannot.
Student: Okay then that make sense
Student: I'm wondering that what classes should I take for next semester since registration date is coming
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I see you've taken EECS477
Student: I've taken EECS280, EECS376, EECS370, EECS476...
Student: Oh by the way EECS376 was a really hard class
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you like EECS477?
Student: What was its topic? I can't remember
Student: Oh intro to algorithms
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS477 is called Introduction to Algorithm
Student: Well it's time consuming
Student: But I liked it
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] There is another upper level algorithm course called Design and Analysis of Algorithm.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's also about algorithm.
Student: I see
Student: I'll consider that
Student: Thank you and have a great day

Student: Haha
Student: Wow it's really code out there
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you advisor?
Student: Hi Advisor
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Sorry, I'm the advisor
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you the student who made the appointment?
Student: I forgot what I was about to say
Student: Oh yes
Student: Nice to meet you
Advisor: [pull-bool] What questions do you have today?
Student: I want to major in Computer Science
Student: But I only took ENGR101
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Oh that's a really good choice
Student: What other mandatory courses do I need to take in order to major in CS?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I'm glad to hear that
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] To major in CS, you should take EECS203 and EECS280.
Student: Are they hard?
Advisor: [pull-fill] By the way, how did you like ENGR101?
Student: It was too easy to me
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Ok, I think you can take 203 and 280 directly.
Student: Can I waive those two classes?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Since you only have taken ENGR101, I don't think it's possible
Student: Alright
Student: How do you think if I take EECS203, EECS280 and EECS376 at the same time?
Student: I believe that I can handle it
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS376 needs some background that is taught in EECS280.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Moreover, EECS280 is a prerequisite
Student: Alright I guess I will take EECS203 and EECS280 next sememster
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I think it's better to take EECS203 and EECS280 in a semester and take EECS376 later.
Student: Thank you!
Student: Have a great day
Advisor: [social-open-close] You too. Bye.

Advisor: [pull-other] Hello student, what would you like to ask today?
Student: I need some advice for course selection next semester.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Glad to help, what class have you taken before?
Student: I have taken several 100 level physics and eecs classes
Student: And some higher level eecs courses
Student: such as data structures and algorithms, Foundations of Computer Organization
Advisor: [pull-bool] OK, so are you interested in data analysis?
Student: Yes, I am interested in data analysis.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your interest, I recommend you to consider about EECS586, Design and Analysis of Algorithms.
Student: What this course is about?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It talks about the design of algorithms of some nonnumeric problems.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] And also is about some cutting-edge design techniques.
Student: Sounds interesting
Student: Is there any prerequisite for this class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, you'd better have some basic understanding on algorithms.
Advisor: [push-other] I think you have satisfied the prerequisite.
Student: I appreciate your suggestion
Student: I will consider this class
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you have any other questions today?
Student: No, that is all questions I have
Student: Bye

Student: Hi, I am considering about class selection next semester
Student: Can you give me some suggestions?
Advisor: [pull-bool] OK, do you have any requirements left?
Student: I don't think so.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Then do you have an explicit preference on course selection?
Student: Yes, I would prefer to those class with lighter work load.
Advisor: [pull-fill] How about EECS183, Elementary Programming Concepts?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is an entry level class.
Student: Sounds like it is not very hard for students without much programming background.
Student: Is there any prerequisite for this class?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you have any basic knowledge on selection and iteration?
Student: I have taken several math classes
Student: But I am not sure what you refer to by "selection and iteration".
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] They are some basic algorithms for programming.
Student: Sounds like a good choice.
Student: One last question
Student: What is the capacity of this class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Since it is an elementary course, the class size is about 124.
Student: Sounds good to me
Student: Thank you for your suggestion
Advisor: [social-other] You are very welcome.

Student: Hello Professor Wu, I have a few questions about registration.
Student: What classes am I required to take?
Student: I've already taken several classes and I like most of them.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What major fields interest you most?
Student: I'm really interested in data and Psychology.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I would suggest database management Systems.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] You may find it difficult at first, but it really get better after mid-term.
Student: I see. Good to know!
Student: Are there any prerequisite classes?
Advisor: [social-other] Not really.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] However, I would suggest taking EECS 376 at the same time.
Student: Cool!
Student: I hope they won't have time conflict.
Student: Do you know what's the class schedule?
Student: And who are the instructors?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I am sure that their schedule won't conflict because many students take them at the same time.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] The instructor will be Professor Prakash if you take the course this semester.
Student: I've heard some good things about these classes.
Student: I'd love to know more about this class. Can I find the syllabus online?
Student: I'd definitely gonna recommend some of my friends to take the class as well!
Advisor: [social-other] Yeah!
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You can find the syllabus on the course page.
Student: Thanks for letting me know!
Student: Have a nice day!

Student: HI there.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Student: I really enjoyed EECS280.
Student: I am thinking about being IA for 280.
Student: How much am I gonna get paid?
Student: And what is the benefit of being IA?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The rate for IA in EECS department is 24 dollars per hour.
Student: Oh that is pretty high.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You should try applying for IA for EECS 280 since you have taken that.
Student: Aha.
Student: I might strongly consider about that.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you do well, you can get a letter of recommendation from Prof. Juett.
Student: Wow.
Student: That is awesome.
Student: I will definitely apply for IA position.
Student: Thank you.
Advisor: [social-continue] Cool.
Student: I think that's all I have.
Student: See you.
Student: Oh I almost forgot.
Advisor: [social-continue] Yeah?
Student: Do you know who is teaching EECS 595 next semester?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It will not be offered.
Student: Really, it will not be offered.
Student: Oh I am so dissapointted
Advisor: [social-continue] Right...
Student: I will talk to Prof.
Student: Oh my.
Student: Okay see you.
Advisor: [social-open-close] See you.

Student: Hello.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hey what's up?
Student: So I am interested in taking AI classes.
Student: Are there any recommendation of AI class?
Student: Especially something related to computer vision?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] EECS 442 is about computer vision.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Maybe you should try that.
Student: Oh that is great.
Student: How about natural language processing.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Prof. Mihalcea is teaching 595.
Student: Oh I see.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] You should be fine since you have taken many 500 level courses.
Student: Oh that is also great. I will probably take 595.
Advisor: [social-continue] Cool.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Anything else you wanna discuss?
Student: No I don't have any.
Student: That was pretty helpful.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Alright. Bye.
Student: Thank you.

Student: Hello there.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi how are you today?
Student: I'm good.
Student: I'm trying to decide what to take next semester.
Advisor: [social-continue] Go on.
Student: Should I take EECS 381?
Advisor: [social-continue] Why are you interested in 381?
Student: Well I think it strengthens my understanding of C++.
Student: Does it make sense?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Yes. Your strength in C++ does make sense.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Which other classes are you interested in?
Student: I'm very enthusiastic about software engineering.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Oh That means you probably should take EECS 481.
Student: Is the workload of that class heavy?
Advisor: [pull-bool] No the class workload is pretty light.
Advisor: [social-continue] Do you have any other questions?
Student: No I don't.
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a good day.

Student: Yo.
Advisor: [social-open-close] what?
Student: I don't want to go to school any more.
Advisor: [social-other] Wow, that was a little absurd.
Advisor: [pull-other] Why you don't want to go to school?
Student: TCHNCLCM300 is getting on my nerve.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] OH you are not in good shape.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] TCHNCLCM300 shall be the easiest class in Michigan.
Student: I don't like the professor at all. He just talks non-sense.
Advisor: [social-continue] Oh, I see.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] That actually happens.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Since it is one credit class.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] And everyone does not spend too much energy on it, including instructors.
Student: Yeah? That's pretty much the case.
Advisor: [social-other] what a shame.
Student: Is there any interesting class you would recommend, at all?
Advisor: [pull-bool] yes I have something to recommend.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] PHIL560 would be a good choice for you.
Student: What is that?
Advisor: [social-other] It is Topics in Philosophy of Science.
Student: It sounds really hard.
Student: Nonetheless I will consider it.
Advisor: [pull-bool] No it is not hard.
Advisor: [social-continue] Yes you should consider it.
Advisor: [social-continue] Do you have any other questions?
Student: That's all I have today.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Okay, see you.
Student: :D

Student: Hello professor!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Oh HI.
Student: I'm alright
Student: I want to switch major.
Advisor: [social-continue] Oh you want to change a major?
Student: Yeah.
Advisor: [pull-select] To which major?
Student: I don't know, but 203 and 280 are both too boring.
Advisor: [social-other] Oh that is too bad for you.
Advisor: [pull-select] So which major are you thinking of?
Student: I'm thinking about History.
Student: But I'm afraid I can't find a job.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Yes the job getting might be hard for you with history major.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I suggest you to stick on CS major if you are worrying about getting a job.
Student: Ugh, fine.
Student: Guess I will need to think twice about this.
Student: Thank you.
Advisor: [social-open-close] That is fair.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Take care.
Student: Bye.

Student: HI
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi
Advisor: [pull-fill] How can I help you?
Student: I'm having some troubles in selecting the courses
Student: I have taken EECS281
Advisor: [pull-fill] Ok, what field interests you most?
Student: I'm interested in computer architecture
Student: And I want to take 400 level courses
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Then I think EECS470 would be perfect for you.
Student: is that difficult?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It depends on the professor, but generally it wouldn't be a big issue.
Student: Great, I want to have a try
Student: Thank you
Advisor: [pull-bool] Sure. Any other questions?
Student: no, thank you.
Student: have a good day
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a good day!

Advisor: [social-open-close] hi
Student: Hi, I am fresher and I am curious about what courses can I take?
Advisor: [pull-bool] are you interested in the 300-level courses?
Student: Sure, what choices do I have?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] You can take EECS370, EECS376, etc
Student: Cool! Can you provide me a little more information about these two courses?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS376 is an introduction to computation theory: finite automata, regular languages, pushdown automata, context-free languages, Turing machines, recursive languages and functions, and computational complexity.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS370 is Course Overview This course is intended to give you a basic understanding of how computers execute programs.
Student: Sounds interesting! Are they difficult?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] No, they are not.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS376 is extremely easy
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS370 is a little bit more difficult.
Student: Perfect! I'll take those two
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] thank you

Student: Hi, I am a Junior and now I am looking for suggestions for courses of next semester.

Advisor: [pull-fill] What specific area in ECE are you interested in?
Student: I am interested in machine learning and natural language processing.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Have you taken a programming class before?
Student: Yes, I took EECS 485 and 484 last semester.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Since you have taken programming class, I suggest you taking EECS 595.
Student: Do I need to take any mathematical courses?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] No, you have completed all the required math course.
Student: Can I take EECS 370?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Yes. Since you have taken EECS281, you may take EECS370.
Student: And what should I take if I am interested in computer vision?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I suggest you taking EECS442.
Student: And what non-tech courses can I take?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You should take technical courses in order to graduate.
Student: Ok, so can I take EECS482?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] No. You need to take EECS370 prior to EECS482
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I suggest you taking EECS370 next semester.
Student: So I have to take EECS370 first and then take EECS482 in the next semester?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes.
Advisor: [social-continue] Can you tell me more about your interests?
Student: NLP and CV are all I am interested in.
Advisor: [social-continue] Any other question?
Student: No, thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Ok, have a nice day.

Student: Hi advisor!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Advisor: [social-other] What can I help you today?
Student: Do you have any suggestions of course planning based on my previous courses?
Advisor: [pull-fill] Do you have a specific area of interest?
Student: Yes, I am looking forward to learn about software development.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I see. However, you need to take the prerequisites first.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would suggest you to take EECS281 and EECS370 next semester.
Student: Are the professors of these courses especially clear in delivering materials?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] From my records, they both have pretty high clarity ratings.
Student: Okay, then I will definitely take these two courses.
Student: By the way, are these courses large in size?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Both of them have a class size around 100.
Student: That sounds fine.
Student: Do you have any other suggestions for course selection?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Considering you background, you could also take another required course EECS376.
Student: Can I take EECS376 along with the two courses mentioned above?
Student: Is workload a problem?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] If you do not want a high workload, I would suggest you not to take all of them together.
Student: Okay, I see.
Student: Thanks for your advising.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi
Student: Hello advisor!
Student: I am wondering which courses I should take next semester.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Which fields are you interested at?
Student: Computer Hardware is definitely the most interesting field!
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] If you want to study computer hardware courses, then you should finish the prerequisites first.
Student: Could you specify what are the prerequisites I should take?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I suggest you to take required courses such as EECS280 and EECS203.
Student: Do they have a high workload? I'd prefer courses with moderate workload.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The workload of these courses are between 2 and 3.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you are going to take these 2 courses, then I also recommend you to take some other fundamental CS courses.
Student: What do you mean by other fundamental CS courses?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS183, for example, is a good course for freshman to learn about fundamental concepts and programming.
Student: Is that a morning class?
Advisor: [push-other] There will be morning sections.
Student: Alright. They I will do EECS203 and EECS280.
Student: Thanks!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Thanks

Student: Hi adivsor
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Zizhen!
Student: I am looking for suggestions on course selection
Student: I have interest in web developing, can you suggest some related courses for me?
Advisor: [social-other] Sure! Let me think for a moment.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] But you have to take EECS203 before any upper level courses.
Student: I want courses of moderate difficulty. How is EECS203?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] The difficulty of this course is only 2.23.
Student: I also prefer a class size of around 100.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] The course normally has a size of 50.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] However, you have to take the Discrete Math if you want to learn more in the field of Computer Science.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Thus, I strongly recommend you to take this course next semester.
Student: Okay, then I will take EECS203 next semester for sure.
Student: Thank you for your advising.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Great! Thanks for coming!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello! Can I help you?
Student: Hi!
Student: I am a CS student in my senior year.
Student: I wonder what courses to take in my last semester
Student: I prefer courses with easy workload
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in user interface development?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The 493 course has a very light load.
Student: That sounds good.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] And 441 is an easy course too.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in mobile apps?
Student: Okay. Does it require group project?
Student: Not so much.
Student: How about software dev
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, 441 has a group project throughout the semester.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you are interested in software dev, 481 will be a good choice for you.
Student: okay. That sounds good.
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You're welcome. Good luck!

Advisor: [social-open-close] hello!
Student: Hello. Could you give me some suggestions for classes to take next semester?
Advisor: [pull-other] what year are you?
Student: This is my sophomore year.
Advisor: [pull-fill] what topic are you interested in?
Student: I'm interested in web development.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] if you like web, you can take 495
Student: Are there any prerequisite courses for 495?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] you should take 281 and 370
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] and I see you have already taken these two classes, good.
Student: Sorry, but I haven't taken any of them.
Advisor: [social-other] sorry my mistake
Student: No problem. Which one do you suggest to take first, 281 or 370?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] most people do theses at the same time
Student: Okay, I will take both of them next semester.
Student: What other suggestions do you have for my next semester?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] the work load is heavy if you take them together so I suggest you take other easy courses along the way
Student: Okay, how about 376? Is it an easy course compared to 281 and 370?
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] if you good at mathematical proof skills then 376 is fair, otherwise it requires a lot of time
Student: Cool. I think I do well in mathematical proof.
Student: I will take 281, 370 and 376 for the next semester.
Advisor: [social-continue] great!
Advisor: [social-continue] any other questions?
Student: I don't have more questions for now.
Student: Thank you for your suggestions!
Advisor: [social-open-close] you're welcome! good luck!

Student: Hello!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, what can I do for you?
Student: I want to take EECS 376 next semester, but I'm still in the waiting list. So I was wondering if I have opportunity to get in?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I'm not sure, it depends on whether other students will drop it. The class is small, but you still have chance.
Student: Fine. If I cannot enroll in that course, do you have any other suggestions?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in programming?
Student: A little.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] If you are interested in programming, you can take EECS 281.
Student: What's that course about?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The name of that course is Data Structures and Algorithms. It will teach you some fundamental data structures and classic algorithms.
Student: Sounds good.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Oh, there is another course, EECS 370, you may interested in.
Student: Yeah, I know that course. But I don't like the class size! Anyway, thanks for your suggestion!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome!

Student: I'm confused about the prerequisite of EECS 376, do you know what is the prerequisite?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, it is EECS285.
Student: Ok, I plan to take five course next semester. Here is my plan, do you think it is reasonable?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you take EECS281, I strongly suggest you to drop something else.
Student: Why?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Because many students reflected that the work load of 281 was heavy. The course has homework each week, several small projects and a large group project.
Student: Oh my god. That's really heavy.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you want to drop something else?
Student: Let me see. Yes, I may drop a cognate course in order to take 285.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] That would be great. You are required to take 285 to graduate. So plan ahead.
Student: Ok, thanks for your suggestion!

Student: I have no idea about courses of next semester. Could you give me some suggestions?
Advisor: [pull-fill] Sure, what topics are you interested in?
Student: I took many courses in different field, like language, physics and math. I want to know more about computer science.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Ok, did you take any courses about computer science?
Student: Yeah, I think I have taken EECS 280, which is about programming and basic data structures.
Advisor: [pull-select] Great! Then which kinds of courses do you like more? Introduction or practical one ?
Student: I prefer introduction.
Advisor: [social-other] Ok, let me think for a moment.
Student: OK
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your interests, there are two courses for you: EECS 376 and EECS 370
Student: What is the difference?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The main difference is that 376 is about computation theory and 370 is about computer and operating system.
Student: Ok, I see. Thanks so much!

Student: Hello.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi.
Student: Can you help me choose a course to take next semester?
Advisor: [social-continue] Of course.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What's your interested area?
Student: web technology and applications
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] That kind of course is a little bit difficult for a sophomore.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You may consider it when you become a junior.
Student: I see
Student: is there a course for Software development or computer hardware?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would suggest 203 for you.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's about discrete math.
Student: Sounds good.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's the mathematical foundations of computer science.
Student: Is this necessary for me to take?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You should know about that if you want to learn those specific areas.
Student: Ok. I will take it then.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The class size is around 55.
Student: I have no huge preference for class size. That is a good size!
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you fine with that?
Advisor: [social-continue] Cool.
Student: Is it a difficult course?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's easiness level is 2.
Student: Perfect, that is my preference.
Student: Thank you so much!

Student: Hello professor.
Student: I would like your help choosing courses next semester.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What area are you interested in?
Student: I am not sure... so far I have several interests.
Student: computer hardware
Student: software development
Student: computing infrastructure
Student: and web technology and applications.
Advisor: [social-continue] It's fine
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You are a freshman.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] EECS 183 should be a good choice.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's Elementary Programming Concepts.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What's your requirement for easiness?
Student: I have already taken ENGR 101 - Intro Comp&Prog. Should I still take EECS 183?
Student: I prefer 2-3 difficulty
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] 183 is more about high-level language.
Advisor: [social-continue] But you are right.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] There will be some overlap.
Advisor: [pull-bool] How do you like course of data structure?
Student: It sounds helpful.
Student: How big is the class size?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] It's a good choice for freshman
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's about 170
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you fine with that?
Student: Yes, that is ok.
Student: Thank you, I will take the data structure course.

Student: Hi professor.
Student: I got confused about what course to take next semester.
Student: Can you help me with that？
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello.
Advisor: [social-other] I can help.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What topics are you interested in?
Student: I will say software development.
Student: Web technology & application is also fine
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you prefer morning or afternoon classes?
Student: Afternoon and evening classes fit me better.
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you prefer easy or challenging courses?
Student: I think class with easiness level 2-3 is good.
Advisor: [social-other] One more question
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in game design?
Student: No... I don't think so.
Advisor: [social-other] I see
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I recommend you take EECS 493
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's difficulty is 2.93 and is an evening course
Student: What is it about?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is User Interface Development
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You will learn how to make it easy for the user to interact with your software.
Student: That's cool.
Student: What's the class size by the way?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The class size is about 90-100 students.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Is that an ok size?
Student: Yes, that's the best!
