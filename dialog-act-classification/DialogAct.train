Advisor: [social-other] How can I help you today?
Student: Hello
Student: I am looking for some EECS courses for next semester
Student: Can you help me?
Advisor: [social-other] Sure I can
Advisor: [pull-other] Do you have specific areas under EECS you are interested in?
Student: No specific areas of interest
Student: Just looking for some moderately advanced courses
Advisor: [social-other] hmm, let me think
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] If you are interested in a moderate introductory course, I would suggest EECS 378 Foundations of computer computer science
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] But, based on your background in Electronics circuits and logic design, I would strongly suggest EECS373 Design of Microprocessor Based Systems
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It should really use your prior knowledge well

Student: Do they have a small class size?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 373 is however a heavy course
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 373 has a large class, about 80
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 378 is relatively smaller, about 45
Student: That should be fine
Student: Are these courses relatively easy?
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you have a preference between electronics circuit design or computer science?
Student: I don't have a specific preference
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] As I mentioned, EECS 373 is a relatively heavy course
Student: I am okay with whatever works based on my profile
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] But given your background, it should be a good fit for you
Student: Relatively heavy is fine with me
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 376 is a foundational course
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Then I would suggest you go with 373
Student: Okay
Student: I will go with your suggestions
Student: Thanks for the help

Student: I would prefer moderately easy courses
Student: But would not prefer very easy courses
Advisor: [pull-bool] Would you be interested in learning about algorithms?
Student: I am interested
Student: But I have heard it has a heavy workload
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I would recommend 281 Data structures and algorythm
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is moderately difficult
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] But given your previous courses, it should not be hectic
Student: Then that should be a good choice for me
Student: What other choices do I have?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] You have taken Logic design and electronic circuits, which are inclined towards electronics and logic circuits
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] building on that, I could recommend 478, Logic circuit synthesis and optimization

Student: I'm in CS minor and need to take some EECS classes this semester.
Advisor: [social-other] I see.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] So you haven
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] So you haven't take EECS 281.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Why didn't you take that class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a really important class even for CS minor student.
Student: I cannot have time to take it last semester.
Student: The schedule just did not work.
Advisor: [social-continue] I see.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Then you should consider take it.
Student: I'll try my best.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Another option is EECS 370.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's an easy class compared with EECS 281.
Student: What's that class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's computer organization.
Student: Is that a hardward class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Not really. You also do some coding for projects.

Student: Cool
Student: Thank you very much.
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome.

Student: Hello!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi.
Advisor: [social-open-close] How are you?
Student: Great.
Student: I'd like to hear your advice.
Advisor: [social-continue] Go forward.
Student: What classes can I take?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Since you only took EECS 280 and EECS 203, you can only take EECS 281,370 or 376 this semester.
Student: Okay.
Student: Which one do you think is the easiest one?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you like EECS 280, then EECS 281 is a good choice.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Or maybe you should consider EECS 376.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] It's like an advanced version of EECS 203.
Student: I do like EECS 203 more.
Student: What's EECS 370 about?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's computer organization.
Student: Wait, so in that class can we make computers by ourselves?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Unfortunately you can't.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's a more conceptual class.
Student: Ah,
Student: Okay.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I think you should take EECS 281.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] That class is the most useful one.
Student: I suppose so.
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Glad to help you!

Student: Hi, nice to meet you.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello, I'm glad to help.
Student: I want some help on course selection.
Advisor: [social-continue] No problem, what kind of help do you want?
Student: What EECS class will you suggest me to take?
Advisor: [social-other] Let me see.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you think EECS 281 is a challenging course?
Student: Not at all. I did pretty well on it.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Then I'd recommend EECS 482.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a really useful class according to past students.
Student: What's it about?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's Operation System class.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you love doing coding then this is the course for you.
Student: Sounds good. I'll look into that.
Student: What else?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] EECS 492 is also a good option.
Student: I heard that it is AI class, right?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, and Prof. Durfee is teaching this class this semester.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] He's really nice.
Student: Is it a hard class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Not really. Its difficult is close to EECS 370.
Advisor: [push-other] So don't worry about it.
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a good day.

Student: Hi!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Nice to meet you.
Student: I want some guidance on my course selection.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What kind of help do you want?
Student: I want to know which EECS courses are good for me.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] You don't have too many options.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] You didn't take EECS 281, so that will be the most important one for you.
Student: What do you mean?
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] After you take EECS 281, you will then be allowed to take a lot of 400 Level EECS classes.
Student: Oh. I didn't know about that.
Student: I should have taken it last semester!
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] It's not too late. In fact, you can take EECS 475 if you want.
Student: Wait, why?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Because it doesn't have EECS 281 as its prerequisite.
Student: What's that class then>
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's introduction to Cryptology.
Student: Cryptography? Sounds cool!
Student: Is it a hard class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yeah... It is relatively hard, compared with EECS 281.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] But I think you will learn a lot if you work hard.
Student: I am very interested in that.
Student: I'll give a try.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Glad to hear that.
Advisor: [social-continue] Anything else?
Student: Oh yeah, can you tell me when is EECS 475?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's Tuesday, Thursday 2-3:30 pm.
Student: Okay. Is it a big class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] There are 64 students currently enrolled.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] If you compared it with other EECS class, then it's not really a big one.
Student: OK, thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello, student!
Student: Hey, my advisor!
Student: I'm wondering what I need to take for next semester to ensure I'm on the right track to graduate?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You are required to take EECS 370, EECS 281, and EECS 376 to graduate.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] And EECS 281 is elective for you.
Student: Would it be too much workload to take all three classes in one semester, in your opinion?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, it would be hard for you to take in one semester.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What kind of topics are you interested in?
Student: I'm very interested in software development, computing infrastructure and web technology & applications.
Student: What prerequisite courses do I need in order to have courses in those topics?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your interests, I'd recommend taking EECS 281 and EECS 370.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Note that EECS 370 prerequisites student must have taken EECS 280.
Student: Are they both morning classes? Because I would like to finish my classes in the morning and then do my other things in the afternoon.
Student: Okay duly noted. And I have taken EECS 280 before, so I'm eligible to take EECS 370.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I don't know whether they are morning class or not.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Yes, given your background, you are eligible to take EECS 370.
Student: No worries. I can check out the class schedule online by myself.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you have any questions?
Student: I will go ahead to add those two courses to my backpack.
Student: No those are all my questions. Thank you so much for the information!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Good, hopefully you will have a great semester.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Welcome welcome! How can I help you today?
Student: Do you have any suggestion on my courses to take next semester?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in AI-related courses?
Student: I guess so.
Student: I don't have preference in terms of topics.
Student: I strongly prefer morning class, because I do not have many time in the afternoon.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I would highly recommend taking EECS492 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, which would introduce the comprehensive framework of the study in AI.
Student: Great, is it in the morning?
Advisor: [push-other] I am not quite sure. You can always check the class schedule online.
Student: Okey, I will check it online myself.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I also recommend any seniors to take EECS482 - Introduction to Operating Systems, because the materials covered in this course would often be tested in a job interview.
Student: How about the difficulty of this class?
Student: And how about the workload? I don't want to have too much workload.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Many students found this course very hard. Its easiness rating is 2.17, which was almost the lowest among all undergraduate courses.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you want to take this course, you might have to drop other courses that have similar level of difficulty.
Student: Alright, anyway thank you for your advices.
Advisor: [social-other] You're very welcome!
Advisor: [social-other] If you don't have any questions, you're good to go!
Student: No, thanks!

Student: Hi!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi. What can I help you?
Advisor: [social-other] As you can see, there are many people looking for help here.
Advisor: [social-other] I'm sorry but we might need to go faster.
Student: I have already spend two years in the EECS, but what I learn here were something fundamental.
Student: I would like to work on something more specific and do some project that can help me to be familiar with the industry.
Student: I am so sorry. I am kind of a slow learner. Sometimes, I talk really slow. So, bare with me! Thank you
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] That should be expected since in general difficult courses require solid background.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] We would like to make all of our students have as many choices as possible so courses for the first two years are focused on giving a comprehensive background.
Advisor: [social-other] I will.
Student: Currently, I took many physics and chemistry. And I kind of like them.
Student: Is there any other advanced course or some experiment course ?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] So based on your preference, I would suggest you to take Logic Synthesis and Circuit Optimization.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You should be able to learn a bunch of skills applicable in the industry.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Professor Igor just came back from industry last year.
Student: How about the intelligence system? Do you recommend any courses related to this topic?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] He should be aware of the latest status in top companies.
Advisor: [social-other] hmmm
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Then I would suggest you to take Foundations of Computer Science first given your prior work.
Student: This sounds wonderful.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Intelligence system is non-trivial so you'd better have a solid background before tapping into it.
Student: DO you recommend me to take all these three courses in the next semester?
Student: Does it better to take only two of them?
Student: I am afraid that I cannot handle the loading.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I think you still have a lot of time to explore so there is no need to take all the courses in one semester.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] It's better to understand one thing thoroughly before move onto another.
Student: Sure. Thank you so much. I decide to take two of them.
Student: Thanks again for your time.

Student: Good morning!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Morning.
Student: I am confused about my class schedule this semester
Student: I don't know what to take in order to meet the graduate requirement.
Student: Moreover, I want to take as many course as possible in this year.
Student: It will be helpful for me if my senior year is much easier.
Advisor: [social-other] I see.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Based on your class history, I think you've been doing great at all time.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Applied Quantum Mechanics might be a good fit for you.
Student: How's the loading for this class
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's a little bit heavy since it has some prereqs.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] However, I believe you're ready for it. You should also challenge yourself at this time.
Student: Is the course in the morning?
Student: I have a part time job in the afternoon.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I think the instructor has not decided its starting time and ending time yet.
Student: Who is the instructor?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] You could wait for a while.
Student: I can try to send e-mail to him
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's Duncan G Steel.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] That's a great idea. He's known for being responsive to emails.
Student: Cool!
Student: That's all.
Student: Thanks for your advice.

Student: Hi
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi. How's your day?
Student: I am good.
Student: This semester I am planing to take EECS203, MATH214, ASAINLAN325.
Student: Is the loading too heavy?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you serious? I think you've taken all of these courses already and know the loading better than me.
Student: Oh~ I am sorry. I made a mistake with the course ID
Student: Instead of tech course, I would like to take more language related courses.
Student: Can I graduate without taking further tech course?
Student: I hate all the math and coding
Student: Do you have any suggestion?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You would need to take some other tech courses in order to graduate.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Since you're in the fourth year of undergrad study, if you don't plan to stay for one more year, I would recommend you to take some tech courses of your interest.
Student: Like?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you don't like math and coding, I think User Interface Development will be suitable for you. It should not have much math and require strong coding skills. You could even take the role of a designer in a team if you really want to avoid coding.
Student: Do you mean that I only need to take one more tech course?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Yes.
Student: Ok
Student: Then, I would take User Interface Development this semester.
Student: Thank you so much
Student: Have a wonderful day!
Advisor: [social-open-close] No problems.

Student: Hi
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Tianyi, how can I help you
Student: Hi, I'm a fresh man in EECS
Student: I have no idea what to select in my first semester
Student: So I select every courses recommended in my first semester
Student: But now I think I'm more interested in easier and less loaded courses in software developing area
Student: Do you have any recommendations?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I think based on your previous courses, I would recommend you take EECS 280 or EECS 183
Student: Sounds great. What are the sizes of those two courses? I prefer class size at about 100
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] However, EECS 183 is heavier than EECS 280
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS183 has a class size around 100-150, while EECS 280 has a class size around 150-200
Student: Oh wow! The how would you score the helpfulness of EECS 183 and EECS 280? which one is more helpful?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] According to previous students, EECS280 scores 4.13 and EECS183 scores 3.63. But both are very helpful courses according to the scores.
Student: Thank you very much!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Chong! How can I help you?
Student: Hi, I am a freshman. I want to know what courses should I take next semester
Advisor: [social-other] Let me see...
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] For most EECS students, they select EECS 280, 183 and 203
Student: I am more interested in software development. Do you know what course is more helpful?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] If you feel good when taking EECS 100, You'll probably like EECS 183
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] And for your reference, EECS 183 is rated as 3.63. Another very useful course is EECS 280, which is rated as 4.13
Student: How about the class sizes. I prefer class size around 100
Student: And what which class is easier, EECS 183 or EECS 280
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 280 is much larger (around 167 every year), 203 is much smaller - around 55, and EECS 183 is about 124
Student: I see. I am interested in EECS 183. What is the clarity rating of this course?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's 3.79
Student: Thank you! I decided to take it

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello, Chong! How can I help you!
Student: Hi, I am a Junior standing student more interested in computer hardware and software development
Advisor: [social-continue] Glad to hear that! So is there any course in hardware area that you've taken?
Student: I have taken EECS270 and EECS370
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Sounds Great. I think for most junior student who have taken those two courses, EECS 373 is the most popular choice for the next semester!
Student: Is that a hard course?
Student: I prefer easier courses
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I think it depends. If you feel good in EECS 370, 373 won't be that hard
Advisor: [pull-fill] Is there any specifications or areas that you are interested in software development? For example, AI, machine learning, website development etc.
Student: I am also interested in intelligent systems and website development
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Great! Then I think EECS 492 might be a great choice, though it is an 4-level course. EECS 484 will teach some website backend stuff, if you are interested.
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome
Student: Are those courses morning sessions?
Student: I prefer morning classes
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 373 is in the mornings of Wed. and Fri., EECS 492 is in the afternoon and EEC 484 is an evening class
Student: Thank you, I decided to take EECS 373

Advisor: [social-open-close] What brings you in, son?
Student: I come to ask about course advice in next semester.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I have seen that you have taken EECS 281 and done a great job.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What is your interest?
Student: I am very interested in artificial intelligence.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I see that you have takend EECS 492.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What other things you are interested in?
Advisor: [pull-select] For example, web development or compiler or infrastructure?
Student: I would like to learn how to build a large software system.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Then I would recommend you to take EECS 482.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You will learn how to build complex software system in EECS 482.
Student: Thank you so much, professor.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Yeah, have a nice day.

Student: Hi professor
Student: I have some question for selecting the courses next semester.
Advisor: [social-continue] Please go on.
Student: I am very interested in enhancing my knowledge in computer science.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I would suggest taking EECS 281 first, since its the fundamental course of all computer science course.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] Then if you would like to further improve the knowledge of how computer works, EECS 376 might be a very good choice.
Student: Can I take both course at the same time?
Student: I am afraid that the workload might be too heavy for me.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Both of them are very intensive course.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] So I would suggest you to only take these two courses plus a very light-loaded course.
Student: Thank you, professor.
Student: Your advice really helps me alot

Student: Hi professor.
Student: I am a fresh man, and I wonder what courses to take in next semester.
Advisor: [social-other] Sure, please have a seat.
Student: Thank you.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What major are you planning to take?
Student: I am most interested in computer science field.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would suggest you to take EECS 183 first, it build up your ability of writing programs.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] And EECS 280 as well.
Student: Are the workloads heavy?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] They are not extremely heavy, but require you to program more.
Student: Thank you, I will keep working hard.
Student: Thanks you for your time.
Advisor: [social-other] You're welcome.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a nice day!

Student: Hi professor
Student: I am here to ask your advice of the course in next semester.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What is your interest?
Student: I am taking computer science as major.
Student: And I like web development the most.
Advisor: [push-other] I see that you haven't take EECS 281 yet.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] It is a very important course if you would like to take computer-related field as major.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in system software, the more infrastructure things?
Student: Yeah.
Student: Not so much compared to web development, but definitely I would want to know more about.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Then EECS 376 and EECS 373 are must-have.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] These course teach you about the layered structure of a computer.
Student: Thank you professor.

Student: Hello
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello Paul!
Student: I need help in choosing classes for next semester
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you have any particular course choices in mind?
Student: yes
Student: I'm interested in Software Development, Web Technology, Computing Infrastructure and Theory
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] Based on your prior courses and your current preferences, I would suggest you to take EECS183 Elementary Programming Concepts or EECS280 Programming and Introductory Data Structures
Student: Which would be more helpful for Computation Theory?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you are more interested in Computation Theory, then I suggest you take EECS203 Discrete Math course.
Student: Does it have a heavy workload?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS203 is a fairly easy course with not much workload.
Student: do you know the class schedule?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I do not know the class schedule for EECS203.
Student: thanks for helping!
Advisor: [social-open-close] My pleasure!
Student: Bye!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Bye!

Student: Hi! How are you?
Advisor: [social-open-close] I'm doing well!
Advisor: [social-open-close] How can I help you today?
Student: I'm freshmen interested in computer science
Student: I have not taken any EECS classes so far. Which one should I start with?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] As a freshmen, I would suggest you start with EECS183
Student: I have no prior experience in computer science. Will EECS183 be too hard for me?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I do not think so. EECS183 is meant for beginners in computer science. It teaches fundamental concepts in programming and does not require any programming experiences.
Student: I see.
Student: How many credits is EECS183?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a 4 credit class
Student: Is it a lecture-only class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] No, it has multiple discussions and you can attend any of them
Student: How many students are there in the class usually?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Around 120 students
Student: I see.
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome

Student: Hello, I would like to get some advice on backpacking for next semester
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi! I can definitely help you with that
Advisor: [social-continue] What are some classes you have in mind?
Student: I'm not sure
Student: I have finished EECS280, can I start taking upper level classes now?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Not yet
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] EECS281 and EECS370 are the prerequisites for most upper classes, so I suggest you take them next.
Student: How is the workload for these 2 classes?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You will find EECS281's workload to be similar to EECS280's, but most students think that EECS370 is relatively harder
Student: I see. Would you recommend taking a third EECS class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Generally, I would suggest taking 2 EECS classes every semester.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] But if you want to challenge yourself, EECS376 is a good foundation class.
Student: Thank you!

Student: Hi!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Student: I'm freshmen and I have taken ENGR151. What classes should I take next?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Given your background, I suggest you take EECS281 next
Student: Who is the professor for EECS281 next semester?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Sugih Jamin
Student: I see.
Student: What other classes can I take?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You can also take EECS376 and EECS370
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] They are also the pre-requisites for many upper level classes
Student: Would you say EECS376 is more helpful or EECS370?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Between the two, EECS370 is more helpful
Student: Who teaches EECS370?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Valeria Bertacco
Student: Is EECS370 also a 4 credit class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, same as EECS281
Student: Ok
Student: I will take EECS281 and EECS370
Student: Thank you
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, how can I help you today?
Student: Hi, I would like to get some advice on what classes to take next semester
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I see you have taken EECS280 and EECS281, you can start taking ULCS classes next semester.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What areas are you interested in?
Student: I'm interested in machine learning
Advisor: [social-other] Great!
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] If that's the case, you can consider EECS492
Student: I don't have any prior experience with machine learning though, is it a hard class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is harder than EECS280 and EECS281, but still on the easy side for ULCS classes
Student: Is it a big class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, EECS492 has more than 100 students
Student: Who is the professor for that class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's taught by Professor Durfee
Student: I see
Student: I think I will take EECS492 next semester
Advisor: [social-other] Sounds good
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] No problem! Thanks for coming in!

Student: Hello!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi! What can I help you with today?
Student: I'm a junior in CS, and I am deciding what classes to take next semester
Advisor: [pull-fill] What classes did you take this semester? Did you like them?
Student: I took EECS482 and find it very hard.
Student: So I'm looking for easier classes next semester
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] In that case, I would recommend EECS485
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is one of the easier classes, and you have satisfied the prerequisites for taking it
Student: What is EECS485 about?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS485 is called web database and information systems. It is about the design and use of databases in the web context.
Student: That sounds interesting! Are there more database classes?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes. EECS484 is also a database class. It is about database management systems.
Student: I think I know what to take!
Student: Thank you
Advisor: [social-open-close] You're welcome

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello.
Advisor: [social-continue] How can I help you today?
Student: I would like to take a class of moderate difficulty and small class size on hardware or AI in the morning.
Advisor: [social-other] Wow, that is a lot of very specific parameters.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] However, you can't take classes on those topics yet, as it seems you haven't progressed very far in CS yet.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I suggest you take EECS 280 now so you can take classes that you are more interested in in the future.
Student: Okay, I guess i'll do that. Thanks.
Advisor: [social-open-close] No problem. See you later.
Student: Goodbye.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Student: Hello.
Student: I'm looking for good courses to take.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you looking for courses in a specific area of CS?
Student: Not in particular.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you looking to take a very difficult class?
Student: No, I would prefer moderate difficulty.
Advisor: [pull-other] Are there any other preferences you should tell me?
Student: I would prefer a class in the afternoon.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Okay. I would recommend EECS 481.
Student: Okay, I'll take that. Thanks!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Goodbye.

Student: Hello, my name is Samoyed. I have some questions about class selection next semester.
Advisor: [pull-other] No problem, anything specific I can help today?
Student: I am not sure if there is any class I am required to take before graduation.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] Given your enrollment record, you still have 3 core classes left.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] They are EECS376 Foundations of Computer Science, EECS281 Data Structures and Algorithms, and EECS370 Introduction to Computer Organization.
Student: Is there any prerequisite for all these three classes?
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] They all have, but I think you have satisfied the requirement considering all classes you have taken.
Student: Really? Glad to know that.
Student: EECS 281 sounds pretty interesting. Could you please tell me more about this class？
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It will give you a basic introduction to algorithm analysis and O-notation, both are very important for your future study in this field.
Student: Is there any other suggestion other than these three classes?
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] No, those are all requirement you will have to complete for graduation.
Student: Which of them is relatively easier?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] In comparison, EECS376 Foundations of Computer Science is the easiest one among these three choices, since it is an entry level class about computation theory.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It basically act as the foundation of other classes related to finite automata, recursive functions, and computational complexity.
Student: Sounds interesting.
Student: I need more time to think about it though.
Advisor: [pull-bool] OK, is there any other problem I can help with today?
Student: That's all questions I have today. Thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] My great pleasure.

Student: Good afternoon! Do you mind to give me some suggestion towards class selection next semester?
Advisor: [social-open-close] Glad to help.
Student: I wonder whether I still have some required class left for graduation.

Advisor: [pull-fill] Do you know programing before?
Student: no
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a class design to make you like programing and knowing people, so wouldn't be too hard.
Student: Can you estimate how many hours do I need to spend on this per week? I need to decide how many other courses to take concurrently
Advisor: [pull-fill] Students say they spend at least 10 hours every week outside of lecture on this course.
Student: cool. thanks
Student: Then I gonna take 183 and 203 and stats250 next semester
Student: so that I can declare major as soon as possible
Advisor: [social-open-close] OK wish you have a good semester

Student: Hi I'm Junyue, can you tell me what course should i pick for next semester?
Advisor: [pull-select] Base on your record, eecs183, eecs203 will be a nice choice
Student: What are these course about
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] These are the two major requirement for eecs major, you have to finish these two class to declare major
Student: Is these two course fun?

Student: I am currently a junior, do you think I have enough time to finish my degree in 2 years?
Advisor: [pull-bool] No, you will need at least 3 year even you work really hard
Student: Oh that sounds a little bit bad...... Can I know the reason for this?
Student: I don't have other courses to take other than cs
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] eecs 281, and eecs 370 is the prereq for most of the user level course.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] you need four user level course and one capstone
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] and you have to take eecs280 and eecs 183 before eecs281 and eecs 370
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] so that is at least 5 semester
Student: So, if I want to accelerate my graduation process, I have to take courses during summer if they are offered
Student: and this might save one semester for me, right?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Yes, you can take eecs 280 at summer
Student: Sure. But since I only need to take cs courses, is there recommendation courses that I can take together with 183 and 203?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] stats 250 is another prereq for eecs major
Student: Sure, thanks
Advisor: [social-open-close] OK, cool, bye

Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Generally speaking, 280 is much harder than the other.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] So I would suggest you to take 280 given your requirement.
Student: Is it a morning class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, 280 is a morning class.
Student: Thank you so much.
Advisor: [social-open-close] That's my pleasure.

Student: Hi, adviser!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Student: I have taken several IOE courses before.
Student: Currently, I want to apply for graduate next year.
Student: Do you have any suggestions for me?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I see you major in computer science.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] 376 is a required course for computer science students.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your situation, I would recommend you to take 376.
Student: Definitely.
Student: And do you have any other suggestions?
Student: I like take some useful courses.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you mind courses with heavy workload?
Student: Fine for me.
Student: As long as it is not a extremely heavy workload courses.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Then you may want to take 482.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a very useful course.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It teaches you many techniques about operating systems.
Student: I have heard about it.
Student: I will take this course also.

Advisor: [social-open-close] My pleasure.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi!
Student: Hello.
Student: I would like to take some programming courses.
Student: I would prefer courses that are a little challenging.
Advisor: [social-continue] Sure!
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you feel 280 difficult?
Student: I feel it normal.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Then, you may probably find the same for 281.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] 281 is the core course for EECS students.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] And it is essential for upper courses.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a little chanllenging.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Given your solid background, I would recommend taking 281.
Student: Thank you for your advice.
Advisor: [social-open-close] That's my duty.

Student: Hi, nice to meet you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello.
Student: I want to take a course related to Web Technology and Application.
Student: Do you have one for me?

Student: Morning course is fine for me.
Student: But I like a course scheduled in the afternoon.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you prefer easier or harder courses?
Student: I like more challenging courses.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Based on your situation, I cannot provide helpful suggestions.
Advisor: [social-other] Sorry.

Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your interests, I would recommend taking EECS 441 (Mobile App Development for Entrepreneurs) and EECS 571 (Principles of Real Time Computing)
Student: Could you tell me class sizes of those two courses?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 441 has a class size of 50, and EECS 571 is about 10 students
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Remember that the latter course is slightly more challenging. So you don't have to take it as a sophomore.
Student: I prefer larger and slightly challenging courses, so I am debating which would be a better option.
Student: Anyway, thank you for your help. I will look into syllabi of those courses.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] In that case, you can look into EECS 591 (Distributed Systems)
Advisor: [social-open-close] No problem. Anything else I can help with?
Student: Nope. Thank you so much.
Student: Have a great evening!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Alright, you too! :)

Student: Hello, how's everything?
Advisor: [social-open-close] Good, how are you doing?
Student: I am doing fine.
Student: I have a favor to ask.
Advisor: [social-continue] Of course, go on
Student: Could you help me with figuring out which course to take next semester?
Advisor: [social-continue] That's what I'm here for :)
Advisor: [pull-fill] What are some of your interests?
Student: Software development is always my favorite.
Student: Intelligent system is also very interesting.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Great, sounds like EECS 481 (Software Engineering) and EECS 492 (Intro to AI) might be good for you
Student: How would you describe workload of those courses?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] They're both fairly neutral in terms of workload.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] As a junior, you've taken similar workload classes before
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The only difference is that EECS 492 is a bigger class. It has around 130 students, whereas 481 has around 60-70 students
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would recommend you to take both
Student: Hmm. How difficult are those courses?
Student: I am okay with both class sizes.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Like I said, they're both good workload given you're a junior. Neutral easy-ness level (around 3)
Advisor: [social-open-close] Anything else I can help you with?
Student: So those courses are easier than EECS 475?
Student: I think I can do both.
Student: Thank you for your help
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] They are both easier than 475
Student: Good!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Great, if there's nothing else, have a good rest of your day!
Student: You too!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello, how can I help you today?
Student: I am interested in taking EECS 470.
Student: I was wondering how difficult the course is?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Given your prior classes, EECS 470 will be fairly difficult.
Student: Would there be any other courses that you could recommend me that may be easier.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] If you're looking for an easier class, I would recommend EECS 373
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] This class is the Design of Microprocessor Based Systems
Student: That doesn't sound like a class I would be interested in, are there any other courses you would recommend?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would also recommend taking EECS281, which is Data Structures and Algorithms
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a fairly easy class
Student: That sounds like a class I would want to take. Thank you

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello! How may I help you today?
Student: Hi, I am unsure about what class to take next semester
Advisor: [pull-select] You have taken many different science courses, is there any particular subject you are interested in?
Student: I found EECS280 and EECS285 really interesting
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] If you are interested in EECS courses, I would recommend EECS 203 which is Discrete math.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] It is a key course for the foundations for computer science courses, so taking it would be very important.
Student: How difficult is the class?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] It is a fairly difficult class.
Student: How large is the class size?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] It is a fairly small class, with about 50 students.
Student: This class doesn't seem like the right fit for me to take next semester
Advisor: [push-other] It is course that is a requirement for many other EECS courses, so I would recommend taking it earlier.
Student: Thank you for the suggestion

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello student, how can I help you today?
Student: I don't know what classes to take for next semester. Could you recommend me some?
Advisor: [pull-fill] What subject matter or major are you interested in?
Student: I am interested in statistics.
Student: I'm also interested in engineering
Advisor: [social-other] From your student information page, I can see that you have taken many EECS and math classses
Advisor: [pull-bool] Would you be interested in taking some upper division EECS classes?
Student: I've taken several and I do find them interesting so that I think that would be good.
Student: Do you have any course recommendations?
Student: I prefer classes in the morning and also aren't too difficult.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I have a list of classes that all start at 9 a.m.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Do you feel more comfortable in a large class or a smaller one?
Student: I prefer a larger class.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Given your interested in EECS, I would recommend taking EECS370, which is an Introduction to Computer Organization class
Student: Okay that sounds good. Thank you
Advisor: [social-open-close] You're welcome! Have a nice day. Go Blue!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Advisor: [pull-other] How can I help you today?
Student: Hi, I'm having trouble deciding what classes to take semester.
Student: Do you have any recommendations?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Will you be trying to graduate in the fall semester?
Student: Yes I am
Advisor: [pull-bool] Will these classes be for electives?
Student: Yes, I have completed all my major requirements
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your previous classes, I would recommend taking EECS 470.
Advisor: [push-other] Which is Computer Architecture.
Student: Wow that sounds really interesting
Student: Thank you for the recommendation
Advisor: [social-open-close] You're welcome and have a nice day.
Student: Go Blue!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello, how can I help you today?
Student: I'm a sophomore interested in software development.
Student: Could you give me any classes that would fulfill major requirements that are in this field?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] There are plenty of classes that you can take to fulfill major requirements
Advisor: [pull-fill] Do you have a preference for class size?
Student: I have taken mainly classes with a large amount of students.
Student: So I prefer those.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Fantastic! I would recommend classes EECS281 and EECS370
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS281 is a Data Structures and Algorithms class
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] And class EECS370 is Introduction to Computer Organization
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Given your interested in software development, these classes would be perfect for you and they also fulfill your major requirements.
Student: That sounds very good. Thank you very much!

Student: Hello.
Student: I need help selecting a class next semester.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi.
Advisor: [social-continue] Can you tell me what career goals you have?
Student: I'm not sure yet.
Student: I have taken a lot of basic courses.
Advisor: [pull-fill] I notice you took ANTHRARC285, which seems very different than your other coursework.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Can you tell me how you feel about the class now that you've taken it?
Student: I thought it looked interesting.
Student: But I did not really like it and probably will not study archaeology.
Advisor: [social-other] Oh okay.
Advisor: [social-other] Thanks for letting me know that.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What did you enjoy the most about the programming courses that you have taken so far?
Student: ENGR101 was interesting.
Student: I liked learning about computer algorithms.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Did you enjoy the process of setting up the overall program, and the overall process of designing a piece of software?
Student: Yes.
Student: I would like to learn more advanced topics in computer programming and software.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Have you conducted any additional computer programming learning on your own, outside of the coursework you've taken?
Student: No. Only in class.
Advisor: [pull-select] How many programming courses would you be willing to take in a semester?
Student: I think I could do two.
Student: I have heard they can get really hard.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would recommend that you take both EECS183 and EECS280 as programming courses this semester.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] These two courses are both logical extensions of the programming courses you've already taken, so they are your next steps if you want more programming experience.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you find that both courses are too much, I would recommend dropping EECS280.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] EECS280 still incorporates a lot of the concepts of EECS183, so if you just take EECS183, you will be in better shape to take EECS280.
Student: I think I will register for both EECS 183 and 280.
Student: Thank you for your help!
Advisor: [social-other] You're welcome.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a good rest of the day!

Student: Hi!
Student: I need help selected courses for next year.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello. Let me see how I can help.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What EECS area are you most interested?
Student: I am most interested in the design and creation of GUI interfaces.
Advisor: [pull-select] Does EECS 485 Web Database and Information Systems or EECS 494 Computer Game Design and Development seem interesting?
Student: Oh. I like the game design one!
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Then I would suggest this course as a good option.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The class size is about 60 people.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Is this okay for you?
Student: Yes
Student: that should be okay
Advisor: [social-other] Great!
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 494 also meets at 3:00pm on Monday and Wednesday.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do these times work for your schedule?
Student: I think they do, though Wednesday will be a little bit long for me with that class added.
Student: it should be okay tho
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] If your schedule permits, you may want to consider taking EECS 485 as well.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is on the same days as EECS 494 but in the morning.
Student: Okay.
Student: I think I will try to take both courses.
Student: Thank you for the help!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You're welcome.

Student: Hi my dear advisor! Long time no see. How are you?
Advisor: [social-open-close] Good thank you! what can I do for you?
Student: I want to do a computer science major, because I want to be a software engineer like my dad!
Advisor: [pull-bool] So, are you going to ask me some advices on your courses?
Student: What classes do I need to take for the major?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Actually, based on your background, I perfectly have two great courses for you: EECS 280 and EECS 183.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 280 is about Programming and Introductory Data Structure, which is fundamental of computer science.
Student: I heard so many good things about EECS 183 from my friends! It sounds like an exciting course! I just have one concern: are the professor and the GSIs helpful in this course?
Student: Okay. Can I take both of them in the same semester?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Sure, they are very helpful I promise.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes you can, since they don't have prerequisites.
Student: Wait a second. My friends told me that you need to take EECS 183 before EECS 280.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] No, I don't think so.
Student: Okay. Maybe my friend was wrong.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] Yes, if you still have questions about this, feel free to email me.
Student: I looked up the professor for EECS183 on RateMyProfessor.com, and found out that the ratings were terrible
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Since EECS183 is an introductory course and is very easy, maybe they just think that it is too easy for them.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] However, as a fresher, it is still worth taking.
Student: Okay thanks for your advice. I will still take it anyway.
Student: Those were all my questions for today.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Good, wish you a great semester.

Student: Hello advisor, how are you today?
Advisor: [social-open-close] I'm doing fantastic! So what are you here for?
Student: Actually, I am a little bit confused by so many courses.
Student: Could you give me some helpful advices?
Advisor: [social-other] Let me pull out your profile in just a minute.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You have taken EECS280 and EECS370 previously. So you're eligible to take both EECS281 and EECS370.
Student: Oh, really? But I have taken EECS 370, and I still need to retake it?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] No you got it wrong. You have taken EECS270, but not EECS370.
Student: Okey, so what kind of courses are them?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS370 is intended to give you a basic understanding of how computer executes programs.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is one of the core courses for computer science major.
Student: I see, and that's good for me.
Student: How about EECS281?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] EECS281 is also a must-take course for computer science major.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is about data structures and basic algorithms.
Advisor: [social-continue] Tell me a bit more what your plan is.
Student: Great! Another question. They are not too easy nor too tough, aren't they?
Student: I think though I have taken various courses, I finally find my interest in computer science.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] All three courses are 4 credits.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] If you want to do computer science, you should not find them hard.
Advisor: [pull-other] What do you want to do next?
Student: I am going to take them and start my journey in computer science.
Student: Thank you for your advices! These are all my questions.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Good morning, sweetheart! What can I do for you today?
Student: I am wondering what classes should I take for next semester.
Student: Could you provide me with any suggestion?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I think EECS183 is a very valuable course to take for a sophomore like you.
Student: Could you give me more details about that course?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is an introductory programming course for both prospective computer science majors in LSA and non-major students.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It will give you a taste of what programming and computer science is like.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Most students go on to do a computer science major after completing this course.
Student: Okey, that sounds good!
Student: How about the class size? I mean, I prefer a large size class.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The class size is 124, so it will be a large class.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] If you complete this course and like it, you can continue to take EECS 280 whose prerequisite is EECS 183.
Student: Great!
Student: And I think I need another course next semester.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] You can consider taking a language course if you did not fulfill your language requirement
Student: Well, I think that might be helpful.
Student: Thank you for your suggestion!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Goodbye!
Student: Bye

Student: Hello Professor
Student: I needed some help deciding courses for next semester
Student: I had some preferences
Student: could you help me out?
Advisor: [social-open-close] I can help you
Advisor: [pull-other] What kind of topics are you interested in?
Student: I have taken a couple of courses in physics in previous semesters
Student: I am looking to continue in similar area
Student: However I do not want any advance courses for now
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would suggest you to take some EECS courses given that you haven't any so far
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested?
Student: Yes
Student: in EECS, I am interested in computer hardware related courses
Student: which one could you suggest?
Student: as an introduction
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I would suggest starting with some basic courses for EECS
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] How about Discrete Math and Elementary Programming Concepts?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] These courses will be a good start for you
Student: How easy are these courses?
Student: and what would the workload be like?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Both these courses are moderately easy
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Given your background, you should be fine handling these courses
Student: Great!
Student: I will look in to this course for my next semester
Advisor: [social-open-close] Great
Advisor: [pull-other] Anything else I can help you with?
Student: This should be all for now
Student: thank you professor

Student: Hello professor
Student: I was looking for courses in EECS
Student: I needed your suggestions on what could I go for next semester
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello
Advisor: [social-other] Let me look at your profile
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Looks like you have already taken some foundation courses in EECS
Student: Yes, I have over the previous semesters
Student: could you suggest some good courses in intelligent systems
Student: I would like courses that would be slightly advance
Advisor: [pull-bool] How about EECS492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] If you need advanced ones, you can also look at EECS477 Introduction to Algorithms
Student: I would like to hear more about artificial intelligence
Student: it is a rising field
Student: would you say 477 would prepare me for 492
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] They should go well together
Student: what is the class size of these courses?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS477 has a class size of 50 and EECS492 has a class size of 125
Student: okay
Student: this helps me shortlist
Student: I think I will go for EECS 477 and 492 together
Student: thank you professor
Advisor: [social-open-close] Great

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello
Advisor: [pull-other] How can I help you today?
Student: Hey Professor
Student: I am looking for some advice to choose my courses
Advisor: [social-continue] hmm
Advisor: [pull-fill] What area are you looking for classes in?
Student: I have no specific interests
Student: I am open to explore
Advisor: [social-other] alright, let me take a look at you prior courses
Student: sure, take your time
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I see you have taken a couple of courses in mathematics department in previous semesters
Advisor: [pull-fill] Would you like me to suggest classes which complement this background?
Student: yes, I have
Student: Sure, I am Interested in exploring
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I'd suggest EECS 281 data structures in algorythm
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] It would involve several concepts like fundamental data structures, tree searches etc, which really build on top of your prior knowledge
Advisor: [pull-bool] Have you looked at this class before?
Student: No, I haven't look at the class
Student: I would like to know if this class has a class size of 100
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] In the past, it has had class size around 80
Student: That should be fine
Advisor: [social-continue] great!
Student: I will go with EECS 281 then
Advisor: [pull-other] Any other questions I could assist you with?
Student: That's it
Advisor: [social-open-close] That's great.
Advisor: [social-open-close] glad I could be of help
Student: Thanks for the help

Advisor: [social-open-close] How's your dad? I heard that he just receive a gold metal from resident Trump
Student: He's doing pretty well. I don't even know you know my father.
Advisor: [pull-other] We studied at the same university. Anyway, how can I help you today?
Student: No wonder. I have no idea about what courses to take for this semester.
Student: Many courses I've taken were not going into the core of real problems.
Student: However, I don't want to waste my money and time on superficial stuff.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] In this case, I would recommend you to take EECS482 Introduction to Operating Systems.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] This course will introduce many detail concepts about OS, and you can have enough time to dive deep into real problems which engineers face everyday.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] In addition, you can also learn how to work with people in the projects
Student: That sounds great!
Student: I've been having trouble in working with others too.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] It would be pretty helpful, if you do spend a lot of time on it
Student: Got it. I will give a try. Thanks for valuable advice!

Student: Hi.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi! How's your day?
Student: Nice.
Student: I have some questions about choosing courses because I have two quite different interests.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What's your interests?
Student: They are engineering and economics.
Student: I want to have a double major when I graduate.
Student: Is that possible?
Advisor: [pull-select] Based on your previous course and the experience, you will have to take more EECS courses.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Which do you prefer? Math or Coding?
Student: Oh.. That's too bad.
Student: Then, I think coding is better,
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you like something related to hardware?
Student: Kind of.
Student: By the way, I don't like a big class.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Then, I strongly suggest you to take Computer Architecture, Software Engineering, Computer Game Design and Development and Design of Microprocessor Based Systems
Student: How do I take all these courses in one semester?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Given your background, it would be fine to take three courses out of these options.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Can you do it?
Student: I see. It look a little bit tough to me but I will give it a try.
Student: Thanks!

Student: Hello!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!

Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your preference of clarity, I recommend EECS 481.
Student: How is the helpfulness rating of that class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The Helpfulness rating of EECS 481 is 3.38
Student: Great, are there any other courses I should take?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I recommend EECS 482, EECS 485, and EECS 487 to seniors.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you were to take EECS 481, I would recommend EECS 485 based on your easiness preferences.
Student: Sounds great, thank you for your help!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Student: Hello!
Student: I would like to know which course I should take next.
Advisor: [pull-fill] How did you like EECS 270?
Student: I enjoyed EECS 270 because it fit my clarity, helpfulness, and easiness ratings.
Advisor: [pull-fill] How about ENGR 101?
Student: I did not. It was too easy.
Student: Is there a morning class that I could take?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Unfortunately, there do not appear to be morning classes
Student: What is the next class I need for a Web and Technology Major?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I strongly suggest sophomores take EECS 280
Student: Ok- What other classes can I take with that?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Would you be interested in EECS 478?
Student: What course is that?
Advisor: [push-other] EECS 478 is Logic Circuit Synthesis and Optimization
Student: What time of day is that at?

Student: Hello!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Advisor: [pull-fill] How may I help you today?
Student: Am I required to take MATH 214 if I've taken MATH 216?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You are required to take MATH 214 if you have taken MATH 216.
Student: I'm trying to take more EECS courses next semester, which ones can I take?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your previous classes, I recommend EECS 376 or EECS 281.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you prefer harder classes?
Student: Yes.
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you prefer earlier or later classes?
Student: I prefer later classes!
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I recommend you take EECS 281 based on your preferences.
Student: Does it have a discussion section?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 281 has a discussion section.
Student: Thank you for your advice!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Student: Hello!
Advisor: [social-continue] How may I help you?
Student: What is a class that I should take next semester?
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you prefer easier or harder classes?
Student: I prefer easier classes.
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you prefer a theory or an application style class?
Student: I have no preference.
Student: I prefer morning classes.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your preferences, I recommend you take EECS 376.
Student: What class is that?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is Foundations of Computer Science.
Student: How difficult is that class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is not very difficult.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Did you find EECS 203 difficult?
Student: No.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Since you did not find EECS 203 difficult, EECS 376 will not be too difficult for you.
Student: Thank you!

Student: Hello advisor
Student: I would like help with choosing courses.
Student: Can you help me?
Advisor: [social-continue] Of course.
Advisor: [pull-select] What topics are you interested in?
Student: I am interested in software development
Student: Also web technology and applications
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your interests, I’d recommend taking 481 or 484
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you prefer class in the morning or afternoon?
Student: I prefer class in the afternoon more than evening and morning
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Then 481-software engineering is in the afternoon
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I strongly suggest juniors take 481
Advisor: [pull-bool] Also are you interested in game design?
Student: I see
Student: I am not interested in game design
Student: is 481 a difficult course?
Advisor: [social-other] Do not worry
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The Projects are often interdisciplinary allowing non-EECS seniors to also take the course.
Student: Great, I will take 481 then.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] As you have taken 482, I strongly suggest you take 481 to move forward
Advisor: [social-other] Perfect.
Student: Thank you very much.

Student: Good afternoon, professor.
Student: I want to talk with you about course selection for next term.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Advisor: [social-other] Sure, I am able to help.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Do you have any interests?
Student: Nothing special...
Student: If I have to say.
Student: I would prefer computer hardware.
Advisor: [social-other] Good to hear.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Since you are a junior, I would recommend EECS 281.
Student: I have a huge preference for morning course
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] It is not computer hardware, but it is a core class required for students.
Student: Is it in the morning?
Student: Oh, that sounds a useful one.
Student: May I ask about the class size?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] On average, the class size is 80 students.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Is this ok?
Student: Yes, I like class with size around 100.
Student: Will it be too difficult for me?

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello, welcome to EECS advising!
Student: Hi there, I was hoping you could help me plan my course schedule for next semester.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Well, EECS281 is the most important course you can take in the curriculum.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] It seems that you won't be able to take many other courses until you take it, so I recommend you start with EECS281
Student: I've heard a little about it. Is it anything like EECS280?
Student: I really enjoyed that class.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS281 is very similar to EECS280 in subject matter.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a continuation off of the what you learned in EECS280.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] The biggest difference is that it has a much smaller class size than what you had in EECS280.
Student: Perfect, that was my one complaint about the class.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Would you like to take any other EECS courses?
Student: If there are any other courses I can take with a rating of 3 in any category, I'd be interested.
Student: I really like the number 3.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Well then you can take either EECS370 or EECS376.
Student: Those both start with 3's, sounds good so far...
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 370 has an easiness rating of 3.24
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] In EECS 376, Professor Strauss has a Helpfulness rating of 2.84
Student: I do feel that a good professor can make or break a class, so I'll go with EECS376.
Student: Thanks for your help, jfranc!
Advisor: [social-open-close] No problem, I'm just glad to help!
Student: I'll admit, I was freaking out earlier about this, but you made it so clear and easy.
Advisor: [social-other] I'm very flattered.

Student: Yes! I am interested in computer science, but I'm a little more interested in computer hardware than other subjects. I like to work with things that are physical.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Looking at the courses that you qualify for, you don't have a lot of options right now.
Student: Well what can I take?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Computer scientists all have to take either EECS280 or EECS183 to open up the broader spectrum of classes.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you want to major in computer science engineering, I would suggest taking EECS280.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS280 will prepare you more for other classes down the line.
Student: Thank you. I will add EECS280 to my schedule.
Student: Are there any other computer science classes that I am able to take?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] No, there are no other classes that you are able to take.

Student: I haven't take EECS 281 yet. Is it necessary?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, you need this for graduation.
Student: Ok, do you think EECS 370, computer architecture is helpful for data science?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It may helpful. But I think help is limited.
Student: Do you recommend me to have this course instead of EECS 281?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your background. I think it is too difficult for you to take EECS 370 without the knowledge of EECS 281
Student: Do you know the pre-requirement for taking EECS 445, machine learning?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You should take EECS 281 before, and you should take some linear algebra course, like Math 214.
Student: Can I take both EECS 281 and EECS 484?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you want to take EECS 281. I think you should drop the EECS 484, 485 or 482.
Student: Why?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Because the pre-requisite of these courses are EECS 281.
Student: I know, I also want to know the requirement of graduate. Do we need to take EECS 484, EECS 485 as our graduation?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, these two courses are needed for graduation.
Student: Thank you. Do you think these two course are needed for data engineer?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I think it helps a little. Data scientist means you need to process the data.
Student: What kind of courses would you suggest me to take in the future?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your interest, I think the NLP, Data Mining and Information Retrieval are very good data courses.
Student: Do you think machine learning is also important for us?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, it is the most important for data scientist.
Student: Ok I know, so you think I should take EECS 281 this semester, and in the next semester, I can take the coding courses I like?
Advisor: [pull-bool] yes
Student: Thank you so much!
Advisor: [social-other] You're welcome.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, I'm your advicer what can i help you
Student: I want to know how to declare computer science major
Advisor: [pull-select] You will have to finish eecs183, eecs280, eecs203, stats250 to declare computer science major
Student: So can I pick any of those class for next semester?
Advisor: [pull-bool] No, because eecs280 has to take after eecs183.
Advisor: [pull-select] But you can take eecs 183, eecs 203, and stats250 togater next semester
Student: Ok, but will these three class have really hight workload?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Not quite, eecs183 should be fun and easy, it design to be interesting and let student love programing.
Student: I never learn programing before, is that OK?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Yes, these course will teach you from beginning, but it will be a little more work if you don't know programing.
Student: So should I still take three class together?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Depend on if you good at math, If you good at math 203 and 250 will be easy for you.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] But if you not good at math, maybe pick one of them, I will suggest you pick eecs 203
Student: I'm good at math, I rather pick two math class than one math one humanity
Advisor: [social-open-close] OK then those tree class will be nice and fun for next semester, good luck

Student: Hi, this is Junyue
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, why are you here
Student: I want to know which courses I should pick for my next semester
Student: are you still there?
Advisor: [pull-select] If you want to do computer science major, you have to take EECS 203
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Because you can not take any other eecs class before you finish the EECS 203
Student: Why? I want to take 281 next semester in order to take upper level cs courses
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] you have to finish eecs 203 before you take eecs 281
Student: how about 370 and 376?
Advisor: [pull-bool] No you really need eecs 203
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] But you can take eecs 203 at summer first
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] so you can take eecs 370, eecs 376, and eecs 281 at fall
Student: omg I don't know that 203 is this important
Student: I have plan for this summer, probably I need to push everything for another semester to just take 203
Student: Any possibility to waive this requirement?
Advisor: [pull-bool] No, but you can email professor to talk about this, otherwise finish other general requirement first
Student: I definitely will do that. If that does not work, is there any other requirement courses to take next semester?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Not in eecs
Student: thanks so umich
Student: much
Student: bye
Advisor: [social-open-close] bye

Student: Hi, I'm Eric
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi
Student: I want to be a computer science student, is this a great field?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, computer science is the best field now.
Student: Is this major hard compare to others such as stats and math?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Yes, the work load will be more that other major, but you are just a fresh men, don't worry too much the one and two level class is fun and easy
Student: Cool, I will try this major and to see if I fit. Then what is the entry introduction course for cs major?
Advisor: [pull-select] EECS183, EECS280, EECS203, STATS 250 is the course you need before declaring the major
Student: Is 183 hard? Cause actually I don't have any related background in cs field and no programming experience. I am afraid of not being able to catch up
Advisor: [social-continue] Are you still there?
Student: yeah
Student: ur noob
Advisor: [social-continue] ur noob too
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS is easy if you are not noob
Student: then how is your gap when you are a student
Student: gpa
Student: gpa
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] 4.0

Student: Hello
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello

Advisor: [pull-other] Ok, what do you want to learn next semester
Student: I want to learn more about CS
Advisor: [pull-fill] What topics are you interested in?
Student: I'm interested in database and AI
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your interests, I'd recommend taking 484 and 492
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Given your background, you may find these courses difficult
Student: Ok, but I really want to learn these topics
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] You may need to drop other courses and focus on these two
Student: That's a good idea
Student: Thanks for you help
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a nice day
Student: You too

Student: Hi
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi
Student: I need some suggestion for next semester's courses
Advisor: [pull-fill] OK, Do you have some interests?
Student: Yes, I like like some courses related to CS and has about 100 class size
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your interests, 370 and 281 would be really good choice for you
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Do you also want to learn some foundation of computer science?
Student: Yes, I'd like to know more
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I strongly suggest people take 376, it's a great course
Student: I heard that course before
Student: Thanks for your advice, I will take these three courses
Advisor: [social-other] I'm glad to help
Student: Thank you, have a nice day

Student: Hello?
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi there!
Student: Why are you here?
Advisor: [social-other] I am here to help you with your academic schedule.
Student: Coincidentally, I'm here to get help with my academic schedule.
Advisor: [social-other] I assure you it's no coincidence.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What kind of EECS courses do you want to take this semester?
Student: I honestly don't have any preference. Software development, computing infrastructure, intelligent systems; they're all the same to me.
Student: After all, we're just specs in the uncaring void of the universe.
Advisor: [pull-select] Well what kind of class size are you looking for?
Student: I would prefer a relatively small class over a larger one.
Student: Though closer to 100 students would be best.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS482 has a class size of 99.6
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your class size preference, I recommend that you take that.
Student: Oh? What's the helpfulness rating of the professor in that class?
Student: If it's not a 3, I'll probably drop it.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's 4.07
Student: Oooh. That's not a 3
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] Well if you're willing to ignore that, I think you should take the class.
Student: Fiiiine...
Advisor: [social-continue] Awesome! Anything else?
Student: Do you have any other classes for me? Maybe that have the helpfulness rating I'm looking for?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You can take EECS487, Interactive Computer Graphics, whose professor, Sugih Jamin, has a helpfulness rating of 2.8
Student: Sigh... Close enough, I guess.
Advisor: [social-other] Well it's a pleasure to be of service.
Student: I'll take EECS482 and EECS487 then. Thanks for the help.
Advisor: [social-other] Sounds good.
Advisor: [pull-other] Is there anything else you need help with?
Student: Nope. See ya round.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Thanks! Goodbye.

Student: Yo, Teach.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Sup, dawg!
Advisor: [pull-other] How's your freshman year going so far?
Student: 'Aight. I've taken EECS203, and if the rest of computer science is as easy as that course, I think I wanna spend my life doing it.
Student: And raking in those CS fat stacks!
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Well, the next EECS classes you have to take have a higher easiness rating that EECS203!
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you know whether you'd prefer to take EECS280 or EECS183?
Student: Yo Teach, I heard great things about Python. Can you hook me up with that?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Python is one of the two languages covered in EECS183, whereas EECS280 doesn't that touch at all.
Student: Then it's EECS 183 for me!
Advisor: [social-other] I'm glad that was such an easy decision for you.
Student: Yo I don't have to take any more EECS classes, right?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Well, my boy, you've got to take EECS183 before other options become available to you.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] For the rest of your schedule, I'd suggest getting some intellectual breadth under your belt, since you need 16 credits before you graduate.
Student: Sounds like a plan.
Advisor: [pull-other] Is there anything else I can do for you?
Student: Nah. Thanks for the help, Homie. I'm out.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Then I hope you have a hip-hoppiting day.

Student: What's the class schedule then?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's between 12:00 pm to 13:30 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Student: OK. That's all for my concern, I will email professor Kevin for more information.
Student: Thanks for your help.

Student: Hi
Advisor: [social-open-close] Good afternoon!
Advisor: [pull-other] How can I help you today?
Student: Hi advisor, could i graduate if i take 281, 376, 370 three EECS classes next semester?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] You only need 8 more credits to graduate.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] But you can take up to 18 credits if you like.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] So sure, you can graduate if you take EECS 281, 370 and 376.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] But taking three classes for the last semester can be tough.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you sure you wanna take three classes?
Student: But what the differences between 281 and 477 since both of them are about the algorithm.
Student: I do not know which class should i enroll next semester, and i want to learning more about the database algorithm.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 281 elaborates on specific algorithms, while EECS 477 is more about algorithm performance analysis and optimization.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I don't think EECS 477 is offered next semester though.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] Based on the fact that you haven't taken any any algorithm courses yet, I think you should enroll in EECS 281 if you want to learn more about algorithm.
Student: EECS 281 sounds like a perfect option for me next semester, but am i qualified to take EECS 281 or not?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Yes, you are.
Advisor: [pull-other] Anything else I can help you with?
Student: I think that is all for today.
Student: Thank you.

Student: Hi there!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, how can I help you?
Student: I would like take some EECS classes in the afternoon next semester, any suggestions for that?
Advisor: [social-other] Hold on. Let me check for you.
Student: Thank you, just take your time.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It seems like none of the class schedules have been finalized yet.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] But you do have up to 10 EECS classes to choose from.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Any other preferences on the course you wanna take?
Student: OK, I would like to learn about the web design, which is my interested domain.
Student: Any suggestions for that?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You can take EECS485.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] It's worth 4 credits.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] The average size of this class is about 128.
Student: Sounds good, I will take that next semester.

Student: Hi there!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi
Advisor: [pull-other] How can I help you?
Student: I am typing to ask any course suggestions next semester for me?
Student: I prefer to take the morning classes and the classes with size around 100 will be appreciate.
Advisor: [social-other] Hold on. Let me check for you.
Student: Sure, take your time
Advisor: [social-other] I appreciate your patience.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You can take EECS 281 or EECS 370.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] They both have a class size slightly under 100.
Student: Could you please brief describe these two classes separately, like what they are mainly talk about during the class?
Student: Like computer hardware focused or software development focused.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 271 is an intro-level class to algorithm analysis and O-notation
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It teaches basic data structures and basic algorithms, like recursive algorithm, greedy algorithms, etc.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 370 is intended to give you a basic understanding of how computer execute programs.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It elaborates on both hardware and software.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 280 is a prerequisite to EECS 370.
Student: Seems like EECS 271 is more suitable to my need, I have already took EECS 280 before.
Student: May i know the EECS 271 clarity rating as well?
Advisor: [social-other] Oops, sorry.
Advisor: [push-other] I didn't mean to mislead you, but it's EECS 281 instead of EECS 271.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The clarity rating of EECS 281 is 3.77.
Student: That's alright, it makes perfect sense.
Student: I think i will take EECS 281 instead of taking EECS 370 since it meets all my requests.
Student: Thanks for your help!

Student: Hi
Advisor: [pull-other] How could i help you?
Student: I want to find out what math courses I can take for the next semester.
Advisor: [social-other] Give me couple seconds, let me check for you.
Student: Great. Thanks!
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I strongly suggest you start to take EECS course rather than Math course next semester.
Advisor: [pull-other] Any EECS course you want to take next semester?
Student: I do want to take algorithm courses, but I'm worried I don't have enough math background. That's why I want to take some math first.
Student: So... is there any intro-level algorithm course I can take?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Based on your interests, I’d recommend taking EECS 477.
Student: What's the class schedule like?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a three-hour class on every Monday, from 9AM to 12AM.
Student: Sounds great.
Student: I think I'll take that class. Thanks
Advisor: [pull-other] Any other classe you are interested in?
Student: Oh wait, how many credits is that class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It worths four credits.
Student: That'll be all I need for next semester.
Student: Thanks for your help.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello.
Student: Hello. I wanna ask for some advice about the courses of next term.
Advisor: [social-continue] Cool, what do you want to know?
Student: Do you have recommendations for some advanced courses in software development?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Given the courses you have taken before, EECS481 Software Engineering, EECS484 Database Management Systems, and EECS485 Web Database and Information Systems would be good for you. It depends on what specific areas are you interested in.
Student: What about the workload of these three courses?
Student: I prefer lower workload courses
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] They are all heavy in workload compared with the courses you have taken. EECS481 may slightly be better.
Student: Ok. Then what are the class sizes of these three?
Student: I think smaller class size may be better.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] EECS481 is relatively smaller. EECS484 and EECS485 are very large, they are among the most popular courses in EECS.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Smaller classes are better for student to learn and interact with the teacher.
Student: Yes, you are right. Thank you for your help today. I don't have more questions.
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are very welcome. Have a nice day!

Student: Hello！
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello boy! What can I do for you?
Student: I have some questions about course selections for next semester.
Advisor: [social-continue] Cool. What's the question?
Student: I'm interested in software development, but I have no idea on which specific course to take.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Have you ever taken EECS281 before?
Student: Yes, I did.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Cool, then you are qualified to take EECS481 Software Engineering, which is very popular course in software development.
Student: What is the lecture time of this course?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] T/TH 12:00-1:30 pm
Student: Great! I like courses in afternoon.
Student: How about the workload?
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] The workload is pretty heavy, but given your performance in EECS281, it won't be that hard.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I suggest that you attend the classes and take some notes.
Student: Thanks for your useful tips.
Advisor: [social-other] You are very welcome! Do you have other questions?
Student: No, that's all. Have a nice day!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a nice day!

Student: Thank you so much for your advice!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You're welcome! Bye!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Student: Hi
Student: I am a upcoming junior student
Student: I am considering about what courses to take next semester to help my internship in the summer
Advisor: [social-other] I am more than happy to help.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What topics or fields are you interested in?
Student: About what you usually do in an intern , maybe web dev, or android app?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] 485 is a course about web development. It mainly uses Python.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in learning Python?
Student: No. I am good at Java.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you are interested in android app, 441 might be a good choice for you.
Student: okay. does the course teach you how to design an app from scratch?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes. 441 involves a team project where you will build your own app from scratch.
Student: I heard that 441 is more about business ideas rather than actually coding
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] There are other courses you might like.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in databases?
Student: yes!
Student: does it teach the trending db like nosql?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Then 484 will be a good choice for you.
Student: okay. i might look into that.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are there any other questions I can help you with?
Student: nothing. I appreciate your help!
Advisor: [social-open-close] No problem. Good luck for your next semester!

Student: Hello!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello! What can I help you with?
Student: I am a junior student major in CS.
Student: I am wondering what courses do you recommend me to take next semester
Student: the only ulcs I have taken is 484
Advisor: [pull-bool] How was your experience in 484? Do you like database?
Student: I think the first half is interesting but i don't like the second half which deal with memory
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Okay. Then 584 might not be a good choice for you.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you more interested in OS or web development?
Student: I never heard of that course
Student: 584?
Student: I am not interested in OS.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] 584 is a course about advanced database systems.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Fine. Do you want to learn about web systems?
Student: I don't think I want to take database anymore.
Student: web system sounds good
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Then 485 will be a good choice for you!
Student: Okay!
Student: What else could you suggest?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in algorithms?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Algorithm questions are common in interviews.
Student: I think 281 is enough for an interview.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Then how about machine learning? It is a popular topic nowadays.
Student: I kind of interested in it.
Student: But it is a good idea to take it with 485?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you are interested in machine learning, then 545 will be a good choice for you.
Student: Because there are about different fields.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The course load of 545 and 485 will be a little heavy.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you want to take them together, I suggest take another course with very light workload.
Student: If I don't want to take 445 next semester with 485 could you suggest other course?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] 441 might be a good choice for you.
Student: Okay. So it is 441 and 485
Student: I think that sounds great .
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Yes! This schedule is good.
Student: Thank you so much!
Student: Have a good day!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You're welcome! Bye.

Student: Hello!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Good evening!
Advisor: [social-continue] How can I be of service?
Student: I am trying to decide which course to take next semester.
Student: Do you think you can help me with this?
Advisor: [social-other] Sure thing!
Advisor: [pull-other] Please tell me what you would like to study.
Student: I am interested in learning more about Computer Hardware.
Advisor: [social-other] There's a course open that seems interesting to you.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in EECS373 Design of Microprocessor Based Systems?
Student: Can you tell me more about this course?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] well, it's a good introduction to Computer Hardware.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] You get some hands on experience with the basics.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I know the lecturer, he's pretty clear in explaining the concepts
Student: It sounds great!
Student: I am really interested in taking a course that would be helpful and easy to understand.
Student: Do you know in which time of the day does the course takes place?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] it's on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10:30 am to 12:00 pm
Student: Perfect!
Student: It works alright for me.
Student: I will take this course then.
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [social-other] You're welcome!
Advisor: [social-continue] Is there anything else?
Student: That is all.
Student: Have a great day!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You too! Bye.

Student: Hello!
Student: I need help with choosing my courses for the next semester.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What subjects are you interested in?
Student: I am interested in Applied Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I recommend taking EECS492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you have any experience with Artificial Intelligence?
Student: I have taken some online courses on my own and I think I know the basic applications of it.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Then I would recommend taking EECS545 Machine Learning or EECS592 Advanced Artificial Intelligence
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Be informed, EECS592 Advanced Artificial Intelligence is the only Depth Star course for the Artificial Intelligence Area
Student: Do you know if in the EECS592 course we learn the mathematical proofs of the concepts presented?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS592 is focused on aplications
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you prefer a mathematical approach, take EECS545 in the Fall semester when it's taught by a ECE professor
Student: Also, I would prefer classes that are held on mornings and don't require a large amount of workload.
Student: Do you know if these 2 classes fit my preferences?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Both EECS545 and EECS592 are hard courses
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would suggest taking EECS492
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] The course is held on Monday and Wednesday mornings
Student: Then, I will take the EECS492 next semester.
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] No problem, have a nice day
Student: Have a great day! Bye!

Student: Hello!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi there!
Advisor: [social-continue] How are you today?
Student: Fine.
Student: Thank you!
Student: I am a bit confused about which course to take next semester.
Student: Can you give me some suggestions?
Advisor: [social-other] Sure!
Advisor: [pull-fill] What are you interested in?
Student: I am interested in Software Development, Computing Infrastructure, Web Technology and some of its applications.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on what I can see here, I would suggest that you take EECS281 Data Structures and Algorithms
Student: Can you give me more details about the content of this course and how it would help me?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] It goes through the basic building blocks of Computer Science
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Any specialization you'd choose will benefit from taking this course.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] The course is of average difficulty, but has above average workload.
Student: It sounds that this course fits my needs perfectly.
Student: I will take it.
Student: Thank you very much!
Advisor: [social-other] Glad to hear that!
Advisor: [social-continue] Anything else I can do for you?
Student: That is all for now.
Student: Have a great day!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Same to you! Bye.
Student: Bye!

Student: Hi
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello there!
Student: I'm interested in choosing my courses for next semester. Can you help?
Advisor: [social-continue] Sure!
Advisor: [social-continue] Can you tell me about which courses will you prefer to take?
Student: I'm interested in going into Computer Science, but I prefer Web Technology and Applications
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] From what I see in your course history you don't have much experience with programming.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I believe that for a good understanding of Computer Science, you have to understand the Mathematics that is at its roots.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would suggest you consider taking EECS203 Discrete Math course.
Student: I wouldn't want a course that's too hard
Advisor: [social-other] You are lucky then!
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS203 is a fairly easy course.
Student: Great!
Student: Do you know if it's in the morning?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, EECS203 is hold during morning hours.
Student: well that's perfect!
Student: Thank you for your time
Advisor: [social-other] No problem!
Student: Have a nice day!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You too!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi student

Advisor: [push-other] I can help you with that.
Student: cool
Advisor: [pull-fill] What subject are you interested in?
Student: I am interested in Computer Hardware
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would recommend EECS470.
Student: How large is that class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It seats 58 students this semester.
Student: Okay, what time is the class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It starts at 0:00:00.
Student: Okay I think that sounds like a good idea
Student: any other recommendations
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Since you are interested in computer hardware, I would also recommend EECS373.
Student: Thank you I will look into it
Student: Goodbye
Advisor: [social-open-close] Goodbye!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi student
Student: Hello, can you help me pick my classes?
Advisor: [social-continue] Yes
Advisor: [pull-fill] Tell me what topic you are interested in.
Student: Web Technology and Applications
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I recommend EECS485 Web Database and Information Systems.
Student: That sounds neat
Student: How hard is that class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It will be easier than EECS482 and EECS492.
Student: alright
Student: any other classes you'd recommend
Student: I like afternoon classes
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I recommend EECS477 Introduction to Algorithms.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It starts at 12pm and ends 1:30pm.
Student: Great I'll take tha
Student: nk you
Student: Thank you for all the help
Student: Goodbye
Advisor: [social-other] You are welcome.
Advisor: [social-open-close] goodbye

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi student
Student: Hi!
Student: I need help picking classes
Advisor: [pull-fill] What class subject are you interested in?
Student: I am interested in Software Development
Student: I also like Web Technologies
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I recommend taking EECS485.
Student: What is that class about?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's titled Web Database and Information Systems.
Student: How clear are the professors?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] It would be the clearest of all the EECS courses you have taken so far.
Student: That sounds good
Student: Any other course you'd recommend given my background?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I recommend EECS481 Software Engineering.
Student: That sounds perfect
Student: How many students are in that class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It seats about 64 students.
Student: great
Student: thanks for your time
Student: goodbye
Advisor: [social-open-close] Goodbye

Student: Hi Advisor!
Student: Can you help me pick my classes for next term?
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Student!
Advisor: [pull-fill] What types of classes are you interested in?
Student: I am interest in Software Development
Student: I am also looking for low workload classes
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I see that you have taken ENGR101.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I recommend signing up for EECS 280.
Student: Why?
Student: What is that class about?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's titled "Programming and Introductory Data Structures" and it covers various techniques and topics such as algorithm development and effective programming, top-down analysis, structured programming, testing, and program correctness.
Student: Okay, what else should I take?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I also recommend taking EECS203: Discrete Math.
Student: This that class hard?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It will be more difficult than EECS280.
Student: hmm okay, what does taking those classes let me do?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] These are introductory courses in the Computer Science curriculum.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Upon completion with at least the minimum passing grade, you will be able to take EECS281 and EECS370.
Student: Nice, what else do I need to take to graduate?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You will need to complete quite a few more EECS courses before graduating.
Advisor: [pull-fill] How did you like Physics?
Student: It was okay I guess
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I suggest that you take more Physics courses.
Student: I'll look into doing that, thanks
Student: how big are 280 and 203 in terms of number of students?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS280 has a class size 167.4 students and EECS203 has a class size of 55.2.
Student: good to know
Student: thanks for your help

Student: Hi Professor Robert
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi.
Student: I am planning to take some courses which have heavier workload
Student: Since the last semester my workload was kind of light that I had plenty of time
Advisor: [pull-fill] Which classes are you interested in?
Student: I am interested in something like Machine Learning or Natural Language Processing course
Student: I have finished most of the Math related courses such as Calculus I and II
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Machine Learning (EECS 545) is offered next semester.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I suggest taking that class and one other course because it has a high workload.
Student: But I am not sure whether my background is strong enough to take EECS 545
Student: And EECS 545 seems like a graduate student course
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Your seem to have taking enough math and EECS courses. It should not be too much for work you.
Student: Sounds good.
Student: Do you have any other suggestion for the courses which can give synergy to EECS 545?
Advisor: [pull-fill] Which other subjects are you interested in?
Student: I actually don't have many ideas. I took a WOMENSTD220 which was very interesting.
Student: Is there any course which is about a combination of Machine Learning and Women Health
Advisor: [push-other] I see you've taking some linguistics classes.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Perhaps you would be interested in Natural Language Processing (EECS 595)
Student: That sounds pretty interesting too
Student: I think I will take these two courses for the next semester
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you have any more questions for me?
Student: I am good now I think
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Great, have a nice day.

Student: Hi Professor.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Robert, what can I help you today?
Student: I was wondering if you could help me find an EECS class to take next semester.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Yes, how much workload do you expect?
Student: I think I can handle a heavy workload. But I don't know if I have the appropriate background for some classes.
Student: Which classes would you suggest?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Since I am thinking you have taken the Programming and Introductory Data Structures, I think it would be great to take Data Structures and Algorithms.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Or you can also try EECS370 Introduction to Computer Organization which has a bit heavier workload.
Student: Ok, are there any other classes I should take?
Student: I'm not sure which subject I'm most interested in.
Student: I'm interested in learning more about computer infrastructure so I think EECS 370 would be good.
Student: Should I take both of those at the same time?
Student: I want to have a moderate workload for the semester.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I also suggest you to take EECS 376 Foundations of Computer Science which gives you an introduction to computation theory.
Student: I think that class might be too far above my experience level.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] The EECS376 is a light one. I think you can pick one more from EECS370 or EECS281 since they are heavier.
Advisor: [pull-bool] No they are not.
Student: Ok, I think I'll take EECS 376 and EECS 281.
Advisor: [pull-select] And sometimes a little bit of challenge is good
Advisor: [social-continue] So do you have any other question about course selection?
Student: No, I think I've decided on those two classes.
Student: Thanks for the help!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome! Have a nice one.

Student: Hi Professor
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Henry
Student: How are you?
Advisor: [social-open-close] Good!
Advisor: [pull-other] How can I help you
Student: I am thinking to take some EECS courses but I don't know which one to choose.
Student: Do you have any suggestion according to my background?
Advisor: [pull-fill] Do you have any specific areas in mind?
Student: EECS related ones
Student: I prefer some heavier courses.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Then how about Web Database and Information Systems EECS 485?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's a 4 credit course and very useful
Student: That one seems good. But I am thinking taking around 3 to 4 courses.
Student: Could you suggest more?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you like something related to AI?
Student: I also want to use my knowledge learned from Math and Physics courses.
Student: Oh, I do.
Student: Does AI course need Math or Physics knowledge?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] 492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence is a very good course
Student: That one sounds very interesting
Student: Yes, sounds good!
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] And 484 Database Management Systems is also a good one
Student: Could you suggest one more? I want to have one more option since sometimes I couldn't get enrolled in the courses I want.
Student: Ohh
Student: Nice!
Student: That's perfect.
Student: Thank you so much!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome!
Advisor: [pull-other] Any more questions?
Student: I think I am good. Thanks for helping!

Student: Hi Professor!
Student: How are you today?
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Henry
Advisor: [pull-other] What can I do for you?
Student: I need some courses in the morning. What do you recommend?
Student: I also want a medium level course.
Student: Not too hard and not too easy
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Then how about Programming and Introductory Data Structures EECS280?
Student: That seems very interesting
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It talks about techniques and algorithm development and effective programming, top-down analysis, structured programming, testing, and program correctness.
Student: I also prefer a class with larger class size
Student: since I want to take course with my friend together
Student: I have many many friends
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 280 is exactly a large class.
Student: Oh and the workload would be as easy as possible.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I think EECS 280 would be good. It is not a heavy class.
Student: Sure. Then I am taking that!
Student: Thank you for helping!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome. Have a nice day.

Student: Hi Professor, how are you today?
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Henry. Good! Thanks.
Student: I am about to register some coureses for the next semester.
Student: Do you have any suggestions?
Student: I don't have too much time for this semester since I am have a part-time job.
Advisor: [social-other] OK. Let me see.
Student: Are you still there?
Advisor: [push-other] It looks to me that you don't have enough background on EECS.
Advisor: [pull-bool] How about some entry level class?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS183 Elementary Programming Concepts might be a good one
Student: Yes, most of the coureses I have done are Math courses.
Student: Sounds good. I always want to learn some Programming.
Student: I think that's the mainstream in the industry.
Advisor: [push-other] Of course
Student: But other than EECS 183, could you suggest some practical courses which have hands-on experience?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] In fact EECS 183 has enough hands-on programming. Students will complete projects and create programs that are practical to life outside of class.
Student: I see. But I need more credits to be as a full-time student for the next semester.
Student: Could you recommend one more?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Then how about Programming and Introductory Data Structures EECS 280
Student: Is it too difficult for me?
Student: Since if I take EECS280 and EECS183, then I am taking 2 programming courses at the same time.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 280 is just a 200 level course.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I think you will just be fine.
Student: I see
Student: Thank you :)
Student: for your helping
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome!
Student: That's very informative
Student: Have a nice day Professor
Advisor: [social-open-close] You too. See you.

Student: Hi
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Henry
Student: How are you Professor?
Advisor: [social-open-close] Very good! Thank you!
Student: How's Ann Arbor treating you so far?
Advisor: [social-other] Very good, I guess!
Advisor: [pull-other] How can I help you?
Student: I am thinking to take some EECS courses
Student: My friends told me EECS courses are heavy workload but very interesting
Student: Do you have any suggestion?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Oh yes. Generally they are.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Do you have any thing in mind?
Student: Yes, EECS courses.
Student: I wan to learn programming!
Student: I need to learn something to help me apply my brilliant Math knowledge.
Student: Do you have any suggestion?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] OK. Then EECS 492 Artificial Intelligence might be a good idea.
Advisor: [push-other] Let's whether a smart mind like you can build some real intelligence.
Student: Don't you think that's a bit too hard for me?
Student: Ohh thank you!
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Oh, that might be. Depends on how smart you are.
Student: But I remember AI is built with reinforcement learning right?
Student: I think I am smart but I don't know whether I am smart enough to build a real AI
Advisor: [push-other] There are several ways to build that.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Reinforcement learning might be too much for you.
Student: Since it has been tried by so many people but none of them has really achieved anything.
Student: What's the reinforcement learning course id?
Advisor: [push-other] Come on! You are still young. Be ambitious!
Student: Okay, then I am taking both EECS 492 and Reinforcement learning.
Student: That sounds good.
Student: Thank you Professor.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you really want to take both of them, you'd better take no more classes.
Student: But I need credits.
Student: I think I'll take one EECS186 Introduction to Programming.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] But you don't want to get a low GPA right?
Student: Three would be enough.
Student: I believe I will make it
Student: We'll see.
Advisor: [social-other] Oh god! Are you really asking me for advise?
Student: :)
Student: Thank you so much!
Student: Have a nice one.
Advisor: [social-other] You too.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, how are you doing?
Student: Hi, I'm good!
Advisor: [social-continue] So are there any particular types of courses that you would like to take next semester?
Student: I am very interested in computer hardware.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Great! There is a course offered in Logic Circuit Synthesis and Optimization, EECS478.
Advisor: [social-continue] Does that sound interesting to you?
Student: What time is the course offered?
Student: I can only take classes in the morning
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Unfortunately the time hasn't been listed yet. I can get back to you later about it.
Student: Ok. Are there any other hardware courses offered in the morning?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I'm sorry, but none of the course times have been listed yet.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Also, there aren't really any other hardware courses next semester.
Student: That's okay.
Student: I'll wait and see about EECS 478
Student: Thanks for your help!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You're welcome! Have a great day.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello, is there anything that I can help you with today?
Student: Hello
Student: I am looking to find one or two classes to fill my schedule
Student: I can only take classes in the morning this semester
Advisor: [social-other] Sure thing.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Unfortunately I don't have the times of any course listings
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] There is one course in Discrete Math that I think would be great for you
Advisor: [pull-bool] Does that sound interesting?
Student: That sounds pretty interesting.
Student: How big is the class?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] It has about 55 students enrolled currently.
Student: That sounds perfect, I like classes on the smaller side
Student: Will EECS 203 serve as a prerequisite for computer hardware classes?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Yes, I believe that it is.
Student: Do you know who is teaching it?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Seth Pettie is the instructor.
Student: Cool, I've heard good things about him.
Student: I'll take that!
Advisor: [social-other] Great.
Advisor: [social-other] I've actually got to go advise another student.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Bye!
Student: Thanks for your help
Student: bye!

Advisor: [social-open-close] hey!
Student: hello
Advisor: [social-continue] what brings you in today?
Student: I am trying to decide what classes to take next semester
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you like working really hard?
Student: In fact, I do!
Student: I really enjoy my classes
Advisor: [social-other] Nice! I might have some good suggestions for you!
Student: I think I still have some general requirements to fill
Student: can you point me in the right direction?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Of course! It looks like you still need to take EECS 281 and EECS 370. You might as well kill two birds with one stone and take them both next semester.
Student: i see
Student: do those classes conflict time wise?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] nope!
Student: awesome
Student: i think i will take those classes
Student: thanks dan!
Advisor: [social-open-close] any time!

Student: hello
Advisor: [social-open-close] hi
Advisor: [social-continue] whats up?
Student: i am really not sure what classes to take next semester
Advisor: [pull-fill] what are you interested in
Student: I really really enjoyed EECS 376
Student: are there any classes like that?
Advisor: [pull-fill] what did you like about 376?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Did you hear that nobody likes that class?
Student: Well I really liked it, i found the material really relevant and interesting to my life
Advisor: [social-continue] yeah?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You might enjoy EECS 477
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] that is the algorithms class
Student: wow! sounds neat!
Student: does it have a lab section?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] no!
Student: great!
Student: and does it count for ULCS?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] you know it!
Student: litty
Student: i guess I will take this class
Advisor: [social-open-close] Cool! If there isn't anything else, have a good day!
Student: thanks for your help dan!

Advisor: [social-open-close] hey!
Student: hello
Student: i am having trouble deciding classes for next semester
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] It looks like you still have quite a few requirements to take
Student: oh really? which ones?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] You haven't taken EECS 376
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Nor have you taken EECS 281
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] As with EECS 370
Student: hmmm, are any of those a prereq for another one?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] No, you can take them all together
Student: wow, that sounds like it will save me tons of time and tuition
Advisor: [social-other] And think how proud your parents would be!
Student: thats so, so true dan
Student: i think i will take these classes together
Advisor: [social-open-close] Glad I could help, see ya!

Advisor: [social-open-close] hello!
Student: hi
Student: im confused about classes for next semester
Advisor: [pull-fill] how can I help?
Student: i need to choose some classes
Advisor: [pull-fill] what classes have you enjoyed?
Student: I really liked EECS 270 since it was hardware focused
Advisor: [pull-bool] would you be interested in taking more CIVIL classes, I see you've taken a lot!
Student: no, i already have taken all my reqs but i want to learn more about computers
Student: are there any classes that might help me do this?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] you're at the university of michigan, of course there are!
Student: what kind of classes?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You would tots enjoy EECS478.
Student: really? What is that about?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Logic Circuit Synthesis and Optimization
Student: sounds really interesting
Student: i need another class though
Student: is there anything really that pairs really well with it?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You seem like a smart kid, you should take EECS 280!
Student: okay that sounds good to me!
Student: thanks for the help!
Advisor: [social-open-close] I'm always here for you!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, Tejas!
Student: Hi
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I see you are a student of Chinese
Student: Yes I am
Advisor: [pull-bool] Yet, your main interest is in CS, no?
Student: Yes, my main interest is in Computer Science
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] I would recommend one of the intro courses (376, 281, 370), OR an upper level.
Student: I have already taken the intro classes. Maybe I will take an upper level course next semester
Advisor: [pull-select] OK, the ones available to you are 478 and 475. Which one appeals to you more?
Student: I would say that I prefer EECS 475
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] 475 is very math-heavy. Have you had experience with group theory?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Have you had experience with group theory?
Student: No I have not. Is that a pre-requisite?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] No, it is not a pre-req.
Advisor: [social-continue] You said you were more interested in 475. Why not 478? elaborate.
Student: I enjoy mathematics and since 475 is math-heavy, I think I would enjoy that more than 478.
Advisor: [push-other] Ok. Hmmm...
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you a Junior?
Student: Yes
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] In that case, please know that math is hard and many students find it not worthwhile?
Advisor: [social-other] Excuse me, that rising tone denoted not a question but instead my attempt to surpress a burp.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you decide to graduate on time, then I would strongly recommend taking EECS 381.
Student: Hmm. That is interesting
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your experience with cryptic languages and authoritarian teaching styles (witness Chinese), I think you would be well-equipped
Advisor: [social-open-close] Ooops, time is up. Any final thoughts?
Student: No that's all
Advisor: [social-open-close] Vale, my dear Tejas. Be well. Get out.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Howdy!
Student: I am Sam
Student: I'm a Senior, but I'very
Student: I am very behind
Student: Could you guide me as to what to take?
Student: That's completely correct. OK, what will I learn in 280?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would suggest that you take EECS 203 and 280 since you seem to have taken all of the necessary pre-reqs for them.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Well, you learn the art of programming. Top-to-bottom completely. You will be a master in CS
Student: Like Donald Knuth's series? I have digested that. Is there any way to skip to 281?
Student: Do you have the power to waive me, or should I talk to someone else?
Advisor: [push-other] OMG. You're such a nerd!
Student: Who is your boss?
Advisor: [push-other] GOD
Student: So when you said OMG, you were calling him over?
Student: I'd be happy to speak with him. Clearly, he is the only one with the power to increase flexibility in UM's CS program
Student: Oh no! I forgot that I have an exam in 25 minutes on Central Campus! I gotta go.
Student: Any final questions I should ask you?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] That maybe, but have you tried talking to David Keiras, he has similar powers
Student: kk bye
Advisor: [social-open-close] BYE!

Student: Hello, I have few questions about course registration in the next semester
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi
Advisor: [social-continue] What are they?
Student: I am a freshman.
Student: I have little experience in EECS
Student: Do you have any recommendations about some EECS classes to start with?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] OK
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] First you can take EECS 203
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's discrete math
Student: Is this useful for EECS students?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It introduces some basic concepts like graph, tree, etc.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's useful
Student: It's great to know that
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Then you can take EECS 183
Student: What is that?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's Elementary Programming Concepts
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] An introduction course about programming
Student: I guess that's a very useful introductory class for me
Student: Thank you for your suggestions!
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You are welcome

Student: hello
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello. What can I do for you?
Student: I have wide interests
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] That is great for a freshman.
Student: Could you please recommend some courses about pysics?
Student: physics
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I am sorry that I only advise for EECS classes.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Do you have any interest in EECS?
Student: Alright
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Cool. I suggest you start with some foundation classes.
Student: I have never taken about EECS lectures
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] For example, EECS203 discrete math is a great start point
Student: Yeah
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] Since you have taken some math and physics classes
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] I think you can do well in EECS203

Student: Hi.
Student: How are you?
Student: I'm not doing great.
Student: I'm very stressed.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Oh no!
Advisor: [pull-other] What is wrong?
Student: I take classes that are too hard.
Student: I want to take classes that aren't easy.
Student: Like goldilocks.
Advisor: [pull-bool] So you want it to be just right? Like Goldilocks?
Student: Yes.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] In that case, you should take Cryptography
Student: Oh, I love cryptography.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is an exciting field.
Student: That is good news.
Advisor: [social-continue] Tell me more about why you love cryptography.
Student: I think that secure communication is the key to a successful digital future.
Student: I plan to become a Cryptography researcher.
Student: I am glad to learn that Cryptography is a middling difficulty course.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] That is a good idea if you like to solve puzzles.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes it is!
Student: What else should I take?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] I would suggest computer organization if you don't mind being bored.
Student: Thank you so much, take care.
Student: Enjoy your life!

Student: Hello
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello, how's it going?
Student: I need help selecting my classes for next semester
Student: .
Advisor: [social-open-close] Great, nice to hear from you.

Advisor: [push-other] Luckily, you can do all of the above!
Student: Great. What are my requirements?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Well, you are a rising senior, correct?
Student: Yes, that is correct.
Student: Wait, never mind. I am actually a Junior
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Well it looks like you should take all EECS courses since you've done lots of electives.
Student: Do I have to?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes.
Student: Okay, sounds good. Thanks!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, how is it going?
Student: Good evening. Is this academic advising?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, I am an advisor.
Student: Ok. I am interested in computer hardware, but it seems to have a lot of workload. Is this true?
Student: What courses do you recommend in the Computer Hardware field that is not very hard?
Advisor: [social-continue] Hmmm.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I think you should take an ancillary class to see an application.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I think you should take Discrete Math or Introductory Data Structures.
Student: Ok. Do you have any suggestions?
Student: That sounds interesting, who teaches those courses?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] These courses help show the importance of Computer Hardware to general society.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Martha Pollack and Georg Essl.
Student: Another question: I would like to know if Karen Gu is teaching any Mandarin Chinese course higher than level 2. Do you know?
Student: I had her in the past.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I do not know the answer to that, sorry.
Advisor: [social-continue] How else can I help you?
Advisor: [pull-fill] What are your course interests?
Student: I am interested in Software Development.
Student: I would like a course in software development with a high level of clarity
Student: And a small class size
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I recommend EECS183. It is the smallest course you still need to take.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is Elementary Programming Concepts.
Student: I will take EECS183 next semester then. Elementary Programming Concepts sounds interesting.
Student: Thank you for your help.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Great, glad I could help.
Student: Goodbye!

Student: Hey, how is it going?
Student: Can you help me with my courses.
Student: I am a rising sophmore.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] I see that you took Physics already.
Student: Yes.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Did you learn anything?
Student: Great question.
Student: I think that objects in the world obey classic mechanics.
Student: It seems that gravity, motion, and more exist.
Student: I did not like the professor that much.
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you like the professor more in Physics or in Calculus I?
Student: I want more software development coursework.
Student: I like math more.
Advisor: [social-continue] Elaborate on ewhy
Student: I like calculus.
Student: I want to both do Math and do applied projects.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Since you have already taken Calculus II, I suggest Discrete Math.
Student: Great suggestion.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Discrete Math is pretty easy and has only 55 students.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Will you sign up?
Student: That fits my desires.
Student: Yes.
Student: Thank you for your help.
Student: :D
Advisor: [social-open-close] YOU ARE WELCOME :)

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, how can I help?
Student: I need to choose classes but I did not like Engineering
Student: I really liked Web technology for some reason I can't recall.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I suggest that you take Computer Game Design and Development.
Student: Why?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a course that is similarly applied like Web technology.
Student: Okay, what is the class size?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The class size is around 53 persons per class.
Student: Ok. That is acceptable.
Advisor: [social-continue] What else do you want help with?
Student: I need a morning class.
Student: What should I take?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Intro to Computer Organization starts in the morning, take that.
Student: Is it easy?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is middlingly easy.
Student: What is really easy?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Intro to Computer Organization.
Student: Ok, great! Thanks!

Student: Hello.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, how is it going?
Student: I need academic advising for next semester.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Great, I can help.
Student: OK. My favorite class last year was about Beatniks
Student: AMCULT208
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You have a diversity of coursework.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I recommend upper level EECS courses.
Student: I prefer something easy. Any specific recommendations?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Foundations of Computer Science is quite easy.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I recommend this course to you.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I also recommend Logic Circuit Synthesis and Optimization.
Student: Is that in the area of Computing Infrastructure?
Student: I heard that was an easy area.
Student: It also has a small class size
Student: Which I like.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is related to computation theory.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a general course.
Student: Do you recommend any Chemistry courses? I have taken some already and would like to continune.
Student: *continue
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is applicable to someone who has not yet taken many upper level courses.
Student: Computation theory could be interesting. Does it meet in the morning?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Your next Chemistry course would be Organic or Inorganic Chemistry.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, it meets in the morning.
Student: My previous chemistry courses received one credit. Are those classes also one credit?
Advisor: [push-other] I am not sure.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Have I been helpful so far?
Student: Ok. I will ask around. Thanks for your help!

Student: I need help!
Student: I have no idea what to take next semester.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello, how are you?
Student: Not great
Advisor: [social-open-close] Nice to meet you, my name is Ronaldo.
Student: Nice to meet you, Ronaldo.
Advisor: [social-other] Oh, that doesn't sound great.
Advisor: [social-continue] Tell me about your problems.
Student: I want to take some language classes. I already speak spanish (hola) and japanese
Student: I prefer all afternoon classes.
Advisor: [social-continue] Konnichiwa!
Student: Do you have any recommendations?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You seem to have a passion for languages.
Student: Si senor
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I recommend that you switch majors to chase your passions.
Student: My major is irrelevant
Student: You should write fortune cookies
Advisor: [push-other] In life, it seems that such pursuits are the way to full embody our own existence.
Advisor: [push-other] Leave University and follow a life of passion and purpose.
Student: Very wise. This was helpful. Thanks!
Student: sayonara
Advisor: [social-open-close] Goodbye and good luck!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi.
Student: Hi there
Advisor: [social-continue] How can I help?
Student: I enjoyed computer vision last semester and am now interested in taking more AI classes
Student: Are there any you recommend?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] EECS545 Machine Learning is one that is fundamentally useful, if you are interested in AI.
Student: Perfect
Student: Is it a challenging class?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Oh yes. Many students find it difficult and drop out after the first quiz.
Student: Oh no :(
Student: Hmm
Student: I think I will sign up for it and take the challenge
Student: I'm really interested in AI
Student: If I don't do well on the first exam I'll consider dropping
Student: What other AI classes could I take?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] EECS595 Natural Language Processing is a good one.
Student: That sounds really fun!
Student: Maybe I'll learn how autocorrect works
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, that is one application of natural language processing.
Student: I've taken a linguistics class and since then have also been wanting to take NLP
Student: Are there any linguistics classes I could take this term?
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] The NLP is cross-listed as linguistics, if that helps.
Student: Ok
Student: Are there other linguistics classes though?
Student: Is there syntax or semantics class?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] LING 110 is about that area, but it will not be offered next semester.
Student: Ah, that's too bad
Advisor: [social-continue] Anything else?
Student: Ok. Are there any other EECS classes you recommend?
Student: Is there a software engineering class?
Student: That would be helpful for my future job probably
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] EECS481 Software Engineering is what you need.
Student: Ok, I will take that
Student: Thanks for your help today!

Student: Hi
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi
Student: I'm a senior interested in CS and Japanese
Student: What classes do you recommend I take this term?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in gaming?
Student: Sure
Student: That sounds fun
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] There is a game design class
Student: Great
Student: I'll take it
Student: Are there any japanese classes offered this term?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] That I do not know.
Student: No problem
Student: What other CS classes could I take?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you are into game development, maybe you want to take a user interface development class as well.
Student: That sounds relevant
Student: I'll take game design and user interface development then
Advisor: [social-continue] Good way to enjoy senior life
Student: I'll be busy looking for a job next term, so plan to take only 2 classes
Student: Thanks for your help

Student: Hello.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi.
Student: I'm junior student. Can you recommend some courses for me?
Advisor: [pull-fill] Yes, which topics are you most interested in?
Student: I'm interested in software develop and intelligent system.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] In that case I would suggest both EECS 481 Software Engineering and EECS 492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.
Student: Are these two classes hard?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Both are considered slightly harder than average courses.
Student: Ok. I think I can do this.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Is there any more information you want to know about these or other classes?
Student: Do you think EECS 492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence is high clarity?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Yes, students tend to find that class very clear.
Student: Also, do you think EECS 492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence is very useful in the future?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence will be very useful in the future.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a very helpful class.
Student: Great! I will take EECS 492.
Advisor: [push-other] That's great!
Student: Thanks for your help.
Advisor: [social-continue] You're welcome.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a nice day.
Student: You too.

Student: Hi~
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, how are you?
Student: Good. I'm fresher and want to explore my interests.
Student: Do you have any suggestions?
Advisor: [pull-bool] That's great, do you have any programming experience?
Student: Yes. I took ENGR101 before.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Ok, there are two EECS courses that may be good for you next semester, they are EECS 183 Elementary Programming Concepts and EECS 280 Programming and Introductory Data Structures.
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you want to have a heavy or light workload next semester?
Student: I think it's light next semester.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] In that case I suggest taking EECS 183 Elementary Programming Concepts.
Student: Are those classes very hard?
Student: Are those classes very hard?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] It is not a very hard class. It's moderate.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] EECS 280 may be too difficult given how much programming experience you have.
Student: What is the size of EECS183?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] It is a fairly large class. The average class size is about 130 people.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Do you prefer smaller classes?
Student: Around 100 people is good.
Student: Then, I think I will take EECS183.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Great, do you have any more questions I can help you with?
Student: No. Thank you very much!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Your welcome, have a nice day!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You're*
Student: You too. Bye.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Bye

Student: Hi how are you
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Henry.
Student: I am here to ask about the courses not in the Engineering Department
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I can only advise you on EECS courses.
Student: Ohhh, okay
Student: Then, what is the most popular EECS course other students are taking?
Student: BTW I am a sophemore
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Since you have taken Introduction to Data Structures I think you should be taking EECS 281 Data Structures and Algorithms next semester.
Student: That sounds good
Student: How's the workload of that?
Advisor: [pull-fill] How many classes are you planning on taking in EECS next semester?
Student: I am considering taking 4 courses
Student: 2 light and 2 heavy
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you are taking EECS 281 that should be one of your heavy workload classes.
Student: Do you have any suggestions on the lights?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I think EECS 376 Foundations of Computer Science would be a good class.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It has a lighter workload.
Student: I see! That's perfect
Advisor: [social-open-close] Do you have any more questions I can help you with?
Student: I think these are enough :)
Student: Thank you for the help
Advisor: [social-open-close] Great, have a nice day!

Student: Hi how are you today?
Advisor: [social-open-close] Good.
Advisor: [pull-fill] How can I help you today?
Student: I'm thinking about what courses to take for next semester. So far I have chosen 3 courses, and I would like to take one more. I'm not sure which one should I take, MATH116, ENGR100 or FRENCH102.
Advisor: [pull-select] Which area do you prefer, science or literature?
Student: Em, I'm a computer science student, I think I will do cs in the future.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Given that you are a sophomore, I recommend you take some basic courses, such as MATH116 to prepare for advanced courses.
Student: OK.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] If you are still interested in language courses, I'd suggest you take them in your junior or senior year.
Student: Thanks, I will do that.
Student: By the way, is Prof. Mark Adams Conger a nice teacher?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Mark is a really nice man. His courses always have students' high ratings.
Student: Cool!
Student: I don't have further questions, thank you so much.
Advisor: [social-open-close] No problem. Have a nice day!
Student: Have a nice day!

Student: Hi!
Advisor: [pull-other] Hello, how can I help you today?
Student: Pretty good! How are you?
Student: Em...I am looking for courses to take next semester.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Sounds good. What are your interested topics?
Student: I like math a lot and I'm considering taking EECS203 Discrete Math next semester, but I'm not sure if it is too advanced for me.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Since EECS203 is an advanced course, you cannot take it unless you take MATH116.
Student: Oh, I didn't know that before.
Student: Thanks for reminding me!
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I suggest you take MATH116 first because It is a useful math course and it is also a pre-requisite for many other advanced courses.
Student: OK, I will do so. Is MATH116 very hard?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Given your academic records, it should not be a problem for you.
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [pull-bool] No problem. Do you have any other questions?
Student: No. Thanks for the help and have a nice day!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Thanks. Bye bye.

Student: Hi, professor.
Student: Could you please give me some hint about the courses to register next semester?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in Computer Science?
Student: Yes.
Advisor: [pull-select] Which one do you prefer, more helpful or less helpful course?
Student: More would be better.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Given your background, you may find EECS 370 difficult.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What class size do you prefer?
Student: Smaller one would be better.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your background and interest, I would suggest you to take EECS 281.
Student: Thanks!

Student: Hi, professor.
Student: Could you please help me to register some courses next semester?
Advisor: [social-other] Sure.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What topics are you interested in?
Student: Software development.
Advisor: [social-continue] Let me think of it.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in courses in the afternoon?
Student: Definitely.
Student: So that I don't need to get up early.
Advisor: [pull-select] Which one do you like more, machine learning or software development?
Student: Software development would be better.
Student: But actually recently I am more interested in web development.
Advisor: [social-other] Oh, I see.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on your interest, I would suggest you to take EECS 485.
Student: Thanks!

Student: Hello
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi
Advisor: [social-open-close] How can I help you today?
Student: I want to do some course planning
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You need three upper level cs courses to graduate.
Student: Alright, do you have any suggestions
Advisor: [pull-select] Do you prefer easy, medium, or hard courses?
Student: I would like to take some easy classes if possible
Advisor: [pull-fill] Ok, so what kind of topics do you like?
Student: I like computer hardware
Advisor: [social-other] I see
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] So you might want to consider EECS 373.
Advisor: [push-other] It's design of multiprocessor based systems.
Advisor: [push-other] Also I see that you haven't taken EECS 376 yet.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] If you want to graduate, you will need to take EECS 376.
Student: OK, so I need to 376 to graduate on time, right?
Advisor: [push-other] Correct.
Student: OK, that sounds good
Student: Thanks for the help
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi!
Advisor: [social-open-close] I'm very glad to be able to help you today.
Student: Hi! I want to plan out my final year
Advisor: [pull-select] Great. Are you more inclined towards hardware or software?
Student: I more attracted by the hardware part
Advisor: [pull-fill] What class sizes do you prefer?
Student: I prefer relatively small class size, like 50~100 people
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Based on the fact that you have taken EECS 270, I suggest you to go on and take EECS 470
Student: Does it satisfy any graduation requirement?
Advisor: [push-other] Yes, it's an upper level cs course.
Advisor: [push-other] It's also a capstone.
Advisor: [push-other] But you can only use it for one criterion.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] But in sum you will need four upper level cs plus one capstone course to grauduate.
Student: Thanks for letting me know, what are some good upper level courses?
Advisor: [pull-fill] What time of the day are you available?
Student: I prefer afternoon courses at this point
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] Ok so if you are free in the afternoon, you might want to take EECS 478.
Advisor: [push-other] It's a circuit course.
Student: That sounds awesome, thank you so much for checking it for me
Advisor: [social-open-close] you are welcome.

Student: Hello
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!!
Advisor: [social-open-close] How can I help you today?
Student: I want to do some course planning
Advisor: [pull-fill] So what kind of areas are you interested in?
Student: I'm very interested in computer hardware and software development
Advisor: [social-other] Ok great
Advisor: [push-other] We have plently of upper level cs courses on hardware and software.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you want to take them, you have to first finish EECS 281.
Student: I have heard of it, sounds interesting. Is there any other good classes?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] usually I would suggest sophomores to finish EECS 370 and EECS 376 earlier.
Advisor: [push-other] Since you have to take EECS 281 before enrolling in any other upper level courses, you can take 376 and 370 to fill in the gap.
Student: Sounds good. Are the course staff helpful?
Advisor: [push-other] 370 is rated as the most helpful one amount these three courses.
Student: Good to know, thanks a lot!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome.

Student: Hi Professor
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Rui, how are you?
Advisor: [social-open-close] what can i help you today?
Student: Good! Thank you. I want know what might be good classes for me to take for the next semester.
Student: Since I will be busy in the morning generally, I prefer some classes for the afternoon.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] Sure, I would suggest EECS376 Foundations of Computer Science
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] which starts at 15:00 and ends at 16:00
Student: Sounds good.
Student: Other suggestions?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's taught by Yaoyun Shi. A very good teacher!
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I also recommend EECS281 Data Structures and Algorithms which is a fundamental course for EECS student.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] But it's in the morning.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Any other question?
Student: Is that too easy for me? I am a junior student now and supposed to take some 300 level courses
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] The course seems easy with its 200 course id but actually it is not that easy.
Student: OK. I see!
Student: Then I will take both.
Student: Thank you professor!
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] If you prefer 300 level courses, I also recommend EECS370 Introduction to Computer Organization.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Sure! No problem! :)
Student: So are you suggesting me taking all of them?
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are more than welcome. The door of advising is always open for you.
Student: I am not sure I can handle all of them
Student: That sounds to much for me
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It really depends on the workload you want to take
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] They are all 4 credits courses.
Student: Just moderate I guess.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] If you really want lighter loading, EECS376 Foundations of Computer Science would be choice.
Student: You already suggested that.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, it's because you want lighter workload.
Student: Are you saying that I should take only 376 and 281?
Advisor: [social-open-close] Yes, that would be an option. But you can also take 370 with 376.
Student: Oh I see.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] since 376 is light, it's good to go with a heavier one.
Student: I will think about it.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Sounds good!
Student: Thank you professor.
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome.
Student: Have a nice day.

Student: Hi, Prof Macy
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Student: I am just not sure what class to choose for the next semester. Could you give me some recommendations?
Advisor: [pull-fill] Which topics are you interested in?
Student: I am not sure, Web development, maybe?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] In that case I suggest taking Database Management Systems (EECS 484).
Student: Isn't that case too easy? I want to learn something really useful and helpful.
Student: Sorry, there is a typo, I mean class
Advisor: [pull-fill] What other classes are you planning on taking?
Student: Maybe something related to intelligent systems?
Student: Oh right, I also plan to take a class about theory, to get some deeper understanding.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I think it would be good for you to take Introduction to Artificial Intelligence EECS 492.
Student: Sounds good! That class seems interesting!
Student: How about another theory class?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you take Artificial Intelligence I suggest not taking a theory class next semester.
Student: Yes
Student: It might be too difficult to handle two heavy workload in one semester.
Student: Great! Thank your professor!
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I agree
Advisor: [social-other] You're welcome.
Student: OK. Thank you. Have a nice day!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a nice day.

Student: Hi Professor Lin!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Robert
Student: I want to take a class related to software development.
Student: Do you have any suggestions?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] In that case, I would suggest you taking the 494 Computer Game Design and Development
Student: Is that a difficult class?
Student: I was also planning on taking a systems class.
Student: And I don't want to overload my schedule.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 494 is not very difficult. Moderate workload.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What systems class do you have in mind?
Student: I'm interested in real-time systems design.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would not suggest that. It is too difficult for a sophomore student.
Student: What would you suggest I take instead?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in intelligent systems?
Student: Yes, are there any classes offered in that area?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS492 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence is offered next semester.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is taught by Emily Kaplan Mower Provost.
Student: Ok, I will the workload of EECS492 and 494 together be too much?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS492 is not a very difficult.
Student: OK, great. I think that is all.
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I think it won't be a problem to take both of them.
Advisor: [social-continue] You are welcome.
Advisor: [pull-other] Any more questions?
Student: No, I don't have any more questions.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Great! Then have a nice day!
Student: Bye!
Student: Bye!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Bye!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Good day, sir or madam.
Student: Hello!
Advisor: [pull-fill] What can i do for you
Student: I would like some advise on some classes that I wish to take next semester.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Your curly hair suggests to me that you are a music major.
Student: That is correct
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] In that case, as I do with all students, I would recommend EECS 203: discrete math.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] If you decide to pursue music, which is traditionally discretized both in pitch and time, then 203 would help you.
Student: Hmm.. I never thought about it that way
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] For instance, Schoenberg's modal rows havegreat combinatorial flavor.
Student: Who is Schoenberg?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Yes, not many people know that 203 has vast applications
Student: Well I think its stupid
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Schoenberg was an influential Austrian composer of the early 20th century.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] He was a proponent of atonalism, just like you (I can tell from the way you speak)
Student: You're not a very smart man are you?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Well, hmm... I am actually a woman
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I identify as a woman, good sir.
Advisor: [social-other] Hmpphh!
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] So, if you wish not to be dragged into a conflict resolution meeting:
Advisor: [pull-fill] Please indicate whether you wish to enroll in 203, drop out of college, or consider apologizing
Student: Quit telling me how to live my life
Student: You're not my mom!
Advisor: [social-open-close] GET OUT OF THIS ROOM!

Student: Howdy I O, Dr. Prahlad
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi! How are you today?
Student: Mooooo I am a cow. That means I am doing well
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you here for an advising appointment?
Student: Well, duh
Student: Can you tell me more about what classes I might take?
Student: For instance
Student: I intend to be a scholar
Student: of Japanese
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I highly suggest taking EECS 482, 470 and 381 together next semester. It will be a light workload and a great accompaniment to your Japanese background
Student: How so?
Student: Also, I have taken ASIANLAN 325; the course guide says: "Under the same course number of ASIANLAN 325, we offer two tracks with different foci: a regular section and a STEM section".
Student: Could you explain more about what the two sections mean?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I highly suggest taking EECS 482, 470 and 381 together next semester. It will be a light workload and a great accompaniment to your Japanese background
Student: (I want to know what I missed: I took the non-STEM section)
Student: Hmm, I have already mastered 482, 470, and 381. For instance, I developed my own operating system on hardware I specially designed.
Advisor: [push-other] Well I know nothing about Japanese. Don't you have a better person to ask
Student: No. I was rejected from LSA and Engineering. That's why I'm a Kinesiology student
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Well in that case, you should drop out of college. You're hopeless
Student: *yawwn* It's getting late. I am an early bird. What courses should I take that meet most early?
Student: Well, I definitely will ignore what you just said
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] I would suggest going home. Goodbye!
Student: OK, thank you very much for your atrocious advice

Student: Hello!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Salve, puer.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you doing well this evening?
Student: I am, thank you for asking
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you enjoyed your chemistry studies, I would recommend taking PHYS 511
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] PHYS 511 deals with the quantum mechanics of electrons and hence explains chemistry
Student: I did enjoy my chemistry classes. What is PHYS 511 about?
Student: Oh wow! I would enjoy that!
Advisor: [push-other] Did you know: one can compute helium's energy levels by pure thought?
Advisor: [social-continue] So, what do you do in your free time?
Advisor: [social-other] *wink wink*
Student: Did you know that I can fly with pure thought
Student: You dirty bugger! Are you a pedophile?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Oh aviation studies? I'm not the expert on this; you should talk to Aero for more details. Or the Avian department in Bio
Advisor: [pull-fill] What? How did you know?
Student: I'm sure the birds in the Bio department can help me out
Advisor: [social-other] In any case
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Holly Sipek has a great helpfulness rating: 4.13
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] out of 5 or out of 10, I forget which
Student: Oh does she now? How do you know? You sleep with her as well you pervert!?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Therefore, I would suggest you take her EECS 280. Sometimes the project themes are birds. other times, card games
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] No, I am totally gay
Student: I understand
Advisor: [pull-bool] So does 280 sound like a good deal?
Student: Yes! Perfect! You are a great advisor!
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] It has no lab, but I would suggest any student to do practice on their own
Student: It does have a lab you idiot
Student: Maybe I'm wrong but you're still an stupid peedo
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] OK, any other way I can help you?
Advisor: [pull-fill] Do you plan on pursuing a BS, MS, PhD?
Student: Yes a PhD
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] OK, then 280 is the way to go
Student: Alright thanks!
Advisor: [push-other] About 1% of 280 students go on to earn a Ph.D. You seem like you
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] are in the 99%
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] By which I mean that, lacking inspiration, you have extreme perspiration
Student: Well you got that right mister. You are beautiful you know that? Actually I DO want to sleep with you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Please, Tejas. Keep this professional.
Student: I will stifle myself
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a great evening.

Student: Hi
Student: Can you help me with the courses I can take next term?
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello
Advisor: [social-open-close] Yes I can
Advisor: [pull-select] Which course did you like ENGR, MATH, PHYSICS or CHEM?
Student: I liked both MATH and ENGR
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You can try EECS203, Discrete Math course
Student: Sounds great.
Student: Any other MATH course that you can recommend?
Advisor: [push-other] I don't think there are other MATH and ENGR courses
Student: Oh no.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you liked ENGR151, you can try EECS183
Student: Oh is that the Elementary Programming class?
Student: That sounds awesome!
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you like it so much you can also take EECS280
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS280 is Programming and Introductory Data Structures
Student: Oh, is that more difficult than 183?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] But it has a large class
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you ok with it?
Student: I think I can manage that
Student: I think that is enough for now
Student: I can decide on other courses myself
Student: Thanks for your help
Advisor: [social-open-close] Thanks

Student: Hello
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi :)
Advisor: [pull-other] How can I help you today?
Student: Can you please help me to select courses for next term
Student: ?
Advisor: [push-other] Sure.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] So, I see you have taken Introduction to Probability and Statistics.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] That was a tough class.
Advisor: [pull-bool] How did you find it?
Student: Tough
Advisor: [social-other] Uh huh.
Advisor: [social-continue] Why would you say that?
Student: The assignments were crazy
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Makes sense. 400 level classes are hard in general.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What did you score in that class?
Student: Not very good.
Student: Only a B-
Advisor: [social-other] Oops.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Did you like Data Structures and Algorithms?
Student: Yeah, that was fun
Advisor: [pull-select] So would you like to Foundations of Computer Science then?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Given you didn't like statistics, I wouldn't suggest you take AI
Student: Oh. AI is great.
Student: Yes Foundations of CS sounds lovely
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes it is. But it is based on statistics.
Student: Then no AI.
Advisor: [pull-bool] I'd also suggest Software Engineering.
Student: Okay. Should I not take some basic CS classes first?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I see you have taken EECS 280 and EECS 281.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] That should be enough.
Student: Okay. I would like to take Software Engineering then.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Instead of AI, I'd suggest taking Computer Game Design and Development.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Does that sound interesting?
Student: No
Advisor: [social-continue] Please alaborate
Student: I think I am good for now
Student: Because game design does not interest me.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Okay. Have a good semester.
Student: Thanks

Student: Hello. This is Shobhit.
Student: I would like to be advised please.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello :) How has your day been?
Student: Great.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] So, I see you took Intro to Programming class with Michael.
Advisor: [pull-bool] How was the class?
Student: I liked it a lot. OMG!
Advisor: [push-other] That is really interesting :)
Advisor: [pull-other] So, what other classes did you like till now?
Student: ENGR100, SI110, and PSYCH111
Advisor: [social-continue] That's nice. What did you like about them?
Student: I think they were good starting courses.
Advisor: [pull-fill] How did you perform in Calculus I?
Student: I did well, got an A!
Advisor: [pull-fill] And what about the other two calculus courses?
Student: Other two?
Student: I just took Calculus II
Student: Got an A- there unfortunately.
Advisor: [social-other] Oops! I am sorry.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] Oh, A- sounds great for a heavy workload class.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would suggest you to take discrete math then.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Discrete math is being taken by Martha this time
Student: Oh okay
Student: I haven't taken any course with Martha.
Student: Don't know how that will work out, but Discrete Math sounds fun
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] I see. I think you'd find it an easy course to do.
Student: Okay!
Advisor: [pull-fill] Are you more interested in theory or programming?
Student: Can you also suggest some PSYCH courses for me?
Student: Theory, I guess
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] PSYCH is an interesting choice.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I'd say you look into graphical psychology of colors, with your background in graphics.
Student: Oh, that sounds intriguing!
Student: Will take that definitely
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] Sounds good.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] For theory, I'd suggest you to take Elementary Programming Concepts. That would give you a good baseline.
Student: Cool
Advisor: [pull-bool] Is that all?
Student: Yes, that was ggreat.
Student: Thank you!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a good day Shobhit :)

Student: hi
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Hi, do you have any questions?
Student: i am interested in database
Student: do you have any recommedation
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Hi, I'm glad that you are interested in database
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I read your transcript and saw that you have taken EECS484
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You might want to take a more advanced database class such as EECS584
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Also, you might take a look at EECS485, which is more web-focused
Student: thank you
Student: sounds good
Student: i am interested in web
Student: so eecs485 is a better choise
Advisor: [social-continue] That sounds great
Student: could you say more about eecs485?
Student: like workload
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Sure. Workload of EECS485 is just as general 4 credit classes
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Based on past surveys, this class has an average easiness rating, so I think you should be fine
Advisor: [social-continue] Do you have other interests or requirements besides web databases?
Student: No. Thank you very much!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You're very welcome. Hope you do well in the classes!

Student: Hello, I have few questions about next semester's classes.
Student: I don't know what classes to take
Student: Do you have any recommendations?
Advisor: [social-continue] Do you have any interest?
Student: I have wide interest in computer science
Student: Do you have any suggestions?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I recommend EECS484 and EECS 485
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] They are both about database
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's helpful for you to find a job in the future
Student: They seem to be great
Student: Are there many students taking these classes?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] These two courses are very popular
Student: It's good to know that
Student: Thank you for help!
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You're welcome!

Student: Hi, I have few questions about next semester's classes
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, what are the questions
Student: I have taken several fundamental EECS classes
Student: But I am not sure about what advanced classes to take.
Student: I am interested in NLP.
Student: Do you have any suggestions?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] yeah
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] There is a course about AI
Student: Which class is that?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] That is EECS 492
Student: Are there many people taking the class?
Student: I personally like a small class for the sake of more interactions.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The class size is a little bit large
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] it's about 125 students
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] But I think you can learn quite a lot in the class
Student: Thanks for help!

Student: hi, I have a few questions about courses for next semester
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi, nice to meet you
Advisor: [social-continue] Sure, what specific questions do you have?
Student: I'm a freshman, but interested in computer science
Advisor: [social-other] It's great to hear that.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Since you have not taken any EECS classes before, I suggest you start with the basics
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] For instance, EECS203 is a great start.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] In EECS203 discrete math, you will learn some mathematical and computer science logics
Student: Great!
Student: Is this a large class?
Advisor: [pull-bool] Yes, it is a large class
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] In the past, usually around 170 students take this class
Advisor: [social-other] I am sorry, I made a mistake
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Actually EECS203 is not a very large class
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Usually around 55 students take the class
Student: lol, I see
Student: Thanks so much for your help!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are very welcome.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Have a great semester!

Student: Hi advisor
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi how are you
Student: Good! I have some questions on my course selection
Advisor: [social-continue] Yep go ahead
Student: I want to take some easy courses next semester
Advisor: [pull-select] OK. Do you have any fields that you are particularly interested in? Like web design, algorithm, or natural language processing?
Student: I would say I am interested in web design
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Cool. I would recommend you taking EECS484.
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] For most students, EECS484 is not a difficult course.
Student: Is it a large class? I would prefer a small class actually
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yep it is
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] However I think it is not a very large course. Generally about 100ish students enroll each semester
Student: Sounds good
Advisor: [social-other] You can have a try for it
Student: No problem I will take that one
Advisor: [social-continue] Great. Do you have any other questions?
Student: Nope
Student: Thank you for your help
Advisor: [social-open-close] No problem! Nice talking to you
Advisor: [social-open-close] Bye
Student: Bye

Student: Hi advisor!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi!
Advisor: [social-continue] How can I help you
Student: I am a freshman! I want to consult CS related courses
Advisor: [social-continue] Great. That is what I am good at
Advisor: [social-continue] What's your question on CS
Student: Em.. What courses should I take for next semester
Advisor: [social-other] Ok let me check your previous courses
Advisor: [pull-bool] Well, seems like you have never taken any CS related courses before, are you
Student: Not yet
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Great. According to the CS policy, you are required to take EECS203 and EECS183 for next semester
Student: Do I need to take both of them?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] You don't need to take both of them in the same semester
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] But you should know both EECS203 and EECS183 are required courses in CS program
Student: ok
Student: How is the workload if I take both of them in the same semester
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] They are good CS courses for beginners. They are interesting and easy
Student: Great. Thank you advisor
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are very welcome! Bye

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello Kangxu, how can I help you
Student: Hi advisor, I would like to know what advanced CS courses I can take for next semester
Advisor: [social-other] Well seems like you have already taken a lot EECS advanced courses
Advisor: [pull-fill] What requirements do you have for next semester
Student: I want to find an easy course. I am available during afternoons
Advisor: [pull-bool] Great. Are you interested in web design and database?
Student: Not at all
Advisor: [pull-fill] I see. How about taking an algorithm course
Student: That sounds good. What course can I take
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] You can take EECS477: Intro to Algorithms
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The class time is on Wednesday afternoon
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] It does not conflict with your current schedule
Student: Yep it looks good to me
Student: Is it a tough course
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I would say EECS477 is a little bit challenge for most students
Student: That is fine. I can accept tough course; just with light workload
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] The workload for EECS477 is medium
Student: Great!
Student: Then I will take it!
Advisor: [social-continue] Yep sounds good. Do you have other questions?
Student: No for now
Student: THanks!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Oh you're welcome

Student: Hi!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi Jay!
Student: Hi Frank. How are you?
Advisor: [social-open-close] I'm fine.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What can I help you with?
Student: I want to pick classes for next semester
Advisor: [pull-fill] What classes are you interested in?
Student: I am interested in math classes
Student: I am interested in a 2-credit class
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I suggest you take Introduction to Algorithms.
Student: Okay. I will take that class.
Student: Am I required to take a software class to graduate?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Yes. You are required to take a software class to graduate.
Student: Okay.
Student: I was wondering what else I need to take to graduate
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] I suggest completing a course on programming before taking a software class.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] In your case, I would suggest taking Object Oriented and Advanced Programming.
Student: Okay. I will look into that for next semester
Student: Thanks for your time. I have to go now.

Student: Hi!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi
Advisor: [pull-other] How can I help you today?
Student: Could you help me with what classes to take next semester?
Advisor: [pull-fill] What classes are you interested in?
Student: I'm interested in Computer Hardware.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] Given the time it is offered, you will have to be a morning person to take Computer Hardware
Student: I do prefer morning classes!
Student: I think I'll take the Computer Hardware course.
Student: But is it too difficult?
Advisor: [social-other] Let me review previous comments about it for a moment.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] Given your history of classes, you should do well in Computer Hardware.
Student: Thanks!
Student: I'll take Computer Hardware this semester.
Student: Thank you for your time!
Advisor: [social-open-close] My pleasure. Take care

Student: Hello!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi there
Student: Could you help me pick classes for next semester? I'm a little confused.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Have you considered taking easy classes?
Student: No. I'm more interested in moderately difficult ones.
Student: Which would you suggest between Computer Hardware and Software Development?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Given the history of hardware courses you have taken, I think you will benefit from a Software Development class.
Student: Sounds fair.
Student: Is there another class that you could suggest, given my course history?
Student: I really prefer morning classes too.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] You are required to take a web development class to graduate and it is offered in the morning next semester.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I suggest you take web development.
Student: How difficult is it?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Web development is of medium difficulty
Student: That would be perfect.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] You have met the requirements for it too.
Student: That's even better! I didn't really look into it before.
Advisor: [social-other] Most students tend to appreciate the skills learned in it too.
Student: I heard it covers a broad spectrum.
Student: How helpful are the professors for that course?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Most Professors teaching the course have office hours twice a week.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] The Professor in the morning session has Saturday office hours too.
Student: That definitely makes my schedule more relaxed.
Student: Thank you so much for your help!
Advisor: [social-other] It has been my pleasure

Student: Hi!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Advisor: [pull-other] How can I help you?
Student: I need help with picking classes for next semester
Advisor: [pull-fill] What class sizes are you comfortable with?
Student: I am comfortable in small class sizes
Student: Between 15 and 30
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I would suggest taking Discrete Math.
Student: Okay.
Student: How many credit hours is that?
Student: Also, what time is it offered?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's class size is roughly 50 students, though.
Student: I can do 50.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It's a 4 credit course.
Student: Okay.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I suggest you get used to classes with larger class sizes.
Student: Why? I thought class sizes got smaller as I get to upper classes
Advisor: [push-other] Yes. But you are yet to fulfill your basic requirements.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Be comfortable with class sizes of up to 150 students.
Advisor: [push-other] Popular courses often are useful courses too.
Student: Okay
Student: Thanks for that insight.
Student: That is all I wanted to know for today
Student: Bye
Advisor: [social-open-close] Good luck!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello, Grant.
Advisor: [pull-fill] How can I help you today?
Student: I'd like help knowing what classes I should take next semester.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Do you have any classes you know you want to take?
Student: I would like to take political science 140.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] If that interests you, it seems like a good option.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Any others?
Student: I am unsure but was thinking about something with a large class size.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Did you enjoy ENGR101?
Student: Well I thought that is was a little difficult.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Do you know what you want to major in?
Student: I am thinking I would like to major in EECS.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] If you want to major in EECS but found ENG101 difficult, I would recommend taking EECS 280. If you find that to be too difficult as well, I would suggest considering another major.
Student: Is EECS 280 generally offered in the morning?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Yes, next semester it is offered 10-11:30AM.
Student: I think I would like taking it in the morning.
Student: Do you have any suggestions on what to take with that?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] Generally, we recommend taking EECS280 with EECS203 due to overlapping concepts.
Student: Alright that sounds like a good plan.
Student: I am done now.
Student: Thank you.

Advisor: [pull-fill] Hi Grant, how can I help you today?
Student: I would like to take some medium sized classes next semester.
Advisor: [pull-fill] What are you planning to major in?
Student: I'm planning to major in computer science.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] After ENGR101, the next classes you should take for the computer science path are EECS 280 and EECS 203.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] However, those class sizes are generally on the larger side.
Student: Alright, that sounds good.
Student: If I wanted to take some easier classes, what should I take?
Advisor: [pull-fill] Besides computer science, what else are you interested in?
Student: I am interested in spanish.
Advisor: [social-other] I personally found Spanish difficult when I was back in college haha.
Student: I found it quite easy when I was taking it before.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] But if it comes easier to you, the next class you should take is Spanish 232.
Student: I am glad to hear that.
Advisor: [social-continue] Why are you glad to hear that?
Student: Because I am interested in taking the next level of Spanish.
Student: I think I'm all good now.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Great, glad I could help.

Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you will take EECS 281, I strongly suggest you to take EECS 370 which is a 4 credit course.
Student: Are there any pre requisites to taking this course?
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] Yes. You should have taken EECS 280, which you have already taken.
Student: Since EECS 370 is a 4 credit course, how helpful is the professor?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] The Professor has a helpfulness rating 4.3 which is considered extremely good.
Student: That sounds perfect.
Advisor: [social-continue] Nice. Continue
Student: I would require one more course to meet the semester credit requirements.
Student: Since the previous two have a heavy workload, can you suggest a course an easier workload. Maybe a 2
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] In that case I would suggest EECS 376 which seems to be a pretty course
Student: OK Advisor, I will take EECS 281, EECS 370 and EECS 376 for the next semester. Thank you for all the help.
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome. Good luck for your semester.

Student: Good morning!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Good morning!
Student: I'm planning my schedule for the next semester. Do you have any suggestions for the courses I should take?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] For a first year student, I would recommend you to take required courses such as EECS280 and EECS203 next term.
Student: What about the workload?
Student: Do you think taking those two courses will be difficult?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The workload is not heavy at all.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] If you choose these two courses, I would also suggest you to take some other computer science courses.
Student: Sounds great.
Student: What's your suggestions?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you are looking for a helpful class, then I would suggest taking EECS183.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] Though the workload of this course is a little heavier.
Student: I see. What is the topic for that course?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The topics of EECS183 includes fundamental concepts of programming, and working with C++ and Python as well.
Student: That sounds interesting.
Student: What about the class size?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The class size is around 120 on average.
Student: Good!
Student: I will take those three.
Student: Thanks for your advice.

Student: Hi Advisor!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello
Student: I'm planning my schedule for the next semester. Could you give me some advice?
Advisor: [pull-fill] Which level of workload are you expecting?
Student: I'm expecting a workload between 2 and 3.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you particularly interested in some area of computer science?
Student: I'm interested in Intelligent Systems.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] You have to finish the prerequisites before taking any upper-level courses.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I would suggest sophomores to take EECS281 and EECS370 as soon as possible.
Student: What about the class size?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] These courses normally have class sizes ranging from 80 to 100.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] And these courses have workload around 3.
Student: That's great!
Student: I will go for them.
Student: Thanks a lot for your advice.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Thanks.

Advisor: [social-open-close] hello
Student: Hello advisor!
Student: I was wondering which courses I should take next semester?
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I strongly suggest you to take 203 and 280 since these are requirements for upper level CS courses
Student: Do you think it's reasonable to take those two courses together?
Student: I think that might be too hard
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] These two courses are not difficult.
Student: Ok. What about the class size?
Student: I'd prefer a class size with about 100 student
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Given your preference of class size, I would suggest you to consider 183 as a good option.
Advisor: [pull-bool] Are you interested in learning about fundamentals of programming languages?
Student: I'm not sure. I do not find a specific interest in fields in Computer Science
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] If you are not sure about specific fields, then I would again suggest you to take 280 as soon as possible.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] It is a course about basic techniques and algorithms and it is a prerequisite for future CS courses.
Student: Ok that makes sense.
Student: May I ask whether there is a morning session for 280?
Advisor: [push-other] I don't think it is a problem.
Student: Ok I will do that.
Student: Thanks!

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello.
Student: Hi. Can you tell me about what classes I need to take?
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I suggest you take all of 281, 370, and 376 next term.
Advisor: [push-conditional-inform] These are all classes that every CS student needs to take.
Student: Are these classes in the morning?
Student: I only want to take classes in the morning.
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] These classes all seem to be morning classes, luckily for you.
Student: Okay, thanks.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Goodbye.

Student: Hello.
Advisor: [social-continue] Hi! How can I help you today?
Student: I'm looking for classes to take for next semester.
Advisor: [pull-other] What are some preferences for the classes you want to take?
Student: I want to take classes with a small class size.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] That might not be possible right now. The next classes you should take are 281, 370, and 376, which are all large classes that every major needs to take.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] I suggest you take these classes now and you can take smaller and more specialized classes later.
Student: Okay, i'll do that, thanks!
Advisor: [social-open-close] No problem, goodbye.

Advisor: [social-open-close] Hello!
Student: Hi. What courses would you suggest for me?
Advisor: [pull-select] Would you like to take difficult or easy courses?
Student: I would like to take courses that are as difficult as possible
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-inform] One course that is difficult that you could take is EECS 381.
Student: How about a class less difficult than that one?
Advisor: [push-conditional-suggest] EECS 587 would bee good if you want a course that is less difficult than 381.
Student: Okay, I'll consider both of those options.
Student: Thanks! Bye.
Advisor: [social-open-close] Bye.

Student: Hello there!
Advisor: [social-open-close] Hi
Student: I am looking for some classes to take in the afternoon.
Advisor: [pull-fill] Cool, what is your interested area?
Student: I am really into software development and Theory of Computation.
Advisor: [push-general-info-suggest] I would recommend you to take EECS 376 and EECS 281
Student: how is the easinessRate for those two courses?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] The easiness rate for 376 is 1.91
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] And that for EECS 281 is 2.53
Student: How big are the class sizes?
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 376 has small class size, which is about 45.4
Advisor: [push-general-info-inform] EECS 281 is bigger, 81.4
Student: I prefer classes with high easinessRating and Larger class size.
Advisor: [push-tailored-info-suggest] Base on your preference, I think EECS 281 would be a good fit
Student: Perfect! I will take this course!
Student: Thank you for your adivce!
Advisor: [social-open-close] You are welcome, have a nice day
